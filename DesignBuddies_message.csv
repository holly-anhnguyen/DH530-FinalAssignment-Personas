1,2022-12-01T19:34:54.071000+00:00,Helloo Im a new ux designer. Im helping my friend set up an online thrift store and would like feedback on a survey
2,2022-12-01T19:25:01.224000+00:00,all ive done is research 1 topic across 10 different platforms to create a userflow somehow combining all the top features & qualities later
3,2022-12-01T19:22:24.419000+00:00,focus on those parts when you're describing it
4,2022-12-01T19:22:19.219000+00:00,(the thing is that ive been here for 2 weeks but trying to expand the details since the way i structure my resume will look like 2ish months)
5,2022-12-01T19:22:10.724000+00:00,Why was it important that you did those specific activities
6,2022-12-01T19:22:03.540000+00:00,What was the value in your activity?
7,2022-12-01T19:21:48.057000+00:00,yeah thats true
8,2022-12-01T19:21:15.104000+00:00,They're all just.. activity. And anyone can do activity.
9,2022-12-01T19:20:51.907000+00:00,and then list bullet points like this as reinforcing description
10,2022-12-01T19:20:40.071000+00:00,I think you should probably summarize these activities into something more punchy
11,2022-12-01T19:20:16.967000+00:00,ehhhhh
12,2022-12-01T19:15:03.135000+00:00,"Hi everyone! I am updating my resume and would like some input on trying to describe my ux research responsibilities (rough idea of what i am going for)

* Conducted competitive audits on Marketing Automation Tools that utilize Conditional Logic
* Created a centralized User Flow and Journey Map focused on simplifying Conditional Logic Automation
* Presented research data findings to design teams and company CEO to be implemented across all aspects of [company] design"
13,2022-12-01T17:11:31.330000+00:00,You can DM it to me if you wish
14,2022-12-01T13:09:04.083000+00:00,E.g. having to map your hours worked / productivity tasks VS explorative task
15,2022-12-01T13:07:43.536000+00:00,Also depending on the user task of course
16,2022-12-01T13:06:53.664000+00:00,"Can still be useful in terms in benchmarks.

While perception is definitely the most important factor, it's nice to have them both. You could in theory do both. First measure their taken time, then follow up with a question that measure the perception."
17,2022-12-01T00:03:01.439000+00:00,"Hello! I'm attempting to do a redesign for LinkedIn and want to release a survey to validate my idea before fully investing time/effort. I'm still pretty inexperienced with making up questions, so I was wondering if anyone could review my survey questions and let me know if it seems like I should ask anything else, if theres clear confirmation bias or too long, etc. Please DM me if you're able and I can provide more context. Thanks! üôÇ"
18,2022-11-30T21:54:20.477000+00:00,and faster =/= better
19,2022-11-30T21:53:03.178000+00:00,long = effort * time
20,2022-11-30T21:51:58.582000+00:00,"From a design perspective, it doesn't matter how fast someone can do something. In that realm of metrics, usually all that matters is the user's perception of how long something is taking"
21,2022-11-30T21:51:23.956000+00:00,I'd also point out that task time generally doesn't matter.
22,2022-11-30T21:17:18.917000+00:00,"Thank you for the explanation and the resource, this will really help me explore this in new ways!"
23,2022-11-30T21:10:49.552000+00:00,So box plot it first to analyse outliers
24,2022-11-30T21:10:10.560000+00:00,Because a small percentage of users will have veryyyy high task times
25,2022-11-30T21:09:49.762000+00:00,But means
26,2022-11-30T21:09:45.696000+00:00,In that way you also don‚Äôt want to calculate averages
27,2022-11-30T21:09:13.379000+00:00,E.g. mean task time of people with x% error rate
28,2022-11-30T21:08:43.527000+00:00,For task times it may be more interesting to analyse it in groups

31,2022-11-30T20:13:41.624000+00:00,"Hello! I‚Äôm a budding UX generalist and I had a couple of questions about compiling baseline statistics after usability testing if someone has the time:
1. When measuring something like average completion time for a task, how do we include participants who fail a task? Or do we exclude them from this calculation?
2. What‚Äôs an effective way to measure error rate? Do we think of it as a binary metric (i.e. they did or did not make an error) or is there a more complex way of measuring this?"

40,2022-11-21T13:47:14.558000+00:00,Is anyone interested in reviewing a research plan I made for a generative activity?
41,2022-11-20T08:20:57.782000+00:00,Outliers?
42,2022-11-20T02:49:22.789000+00:00,uhh bystanders? un-targeted audience? outsiders? non-participants
43,2022-11-20T02:36:33.648000+00:00,Ok I will dm
44,2022-11-19T22:40:42.462000+00:00,wait is it marginalized users
45,2022-11-19T22:40:36.945000+00:00,like sideline cases? side cases? peripheral cases? marginalized users?
46,2022-11-19T22:07:02.278000+00:00,Indirect users?
47,2022-11-19T20:45:20.773000+00:00,"hey guys, i was trying to type up something and I forget the name for this group of individuals that you design for. There's the target intended audience, then there's the ""other"" group that your product should also consider for. What's that group called?"
48,2022-11-19T07:32:48.822000+00:00,Sure
49,2022-11-19T04:21:38.700000+00:00,Is anyone here interested in re evaluating or reviewing a screener and survey Ive made
50,2022-11-18T17:48:31.214000+00:00,What kind of events
51,2022-11-17T21:05:33.793000+00:00,"Thank you, cool tips, definitely helpful!"

55,2022-11-17T16:30:30.485000+00:00,"some information , but not all"
56,2022-11-17T16:20:05.463000+00:00,"Thank you, yeah this was helpful!"
57,2022-11-17T15:58:21.876000+00:00,Does that mean you have your answer?
58,2022-11-17T15:56:33.071000+00:00,"you can use this data to know which metrics / approaches are more accurate than others , and then apply those."
59,2022-11-17T15:54:01.719000+00:00,And therefore?
60,2022-11-17T15:48:54.479000+00:00,"e.g.` Why are that metrics most important?` this question can be answer; it's more accurate because this , and this and this"
61,2022-11-17T15:42:53.677000+00:00,I'm not following you
62,2022-11-17T15:42:24.778000+00:00,"`- Why are that metrics most important?` why not just keep the top formulas and it can change their way to interprate , but the most accurate it's the main formula to display information"
63,2022-11-17T15:40:02.375000+00:00,Then ask questions about the areas you don't know
64,2022-11-17T15:35:28.076000+00:00,"this questions more about end user needs to be done with dietitian , since users only will take photos or even nothing"
65,2022-11-17T15:34:15.041000+00:00,"I dont have exactly as my final product , but I can reutilize some UI from dribbble to show up , and then remove everything users dont want or the idea dont fit on"
66,2022-11-17T15:32:38.012000+00:00,oh wireframes
67,2022-11-17T15:32:05.366000+00:00,"their workflow isnt complex ; and the most complex workflow comes from dietitian , and personal trainer just weights, workout plan , and that's it"
68,2022-11-17T15:31:46.988000+00:00,I mean design you idea to something people can see
69,2022-11-17T15:31:36.618000+00:00,"Which data do you use to measure body progress?
- Which metrics are the most important here?
- Why are that metrics most important?
- (Then more question that go in depth about metric collection and barriers that make it more difficult)"
70,2022-11-17T15:30:58.142000+00:00,what do you mean?
71,2022-11-17T15:30:16.308000+00:00,Most things you ask here you can just ask directly
72,2022-11-17T15:29:52.616000+00:00,And what are you having dififculty with?
73,2022-11-17T15:29:40.797000+00:00,"understanding their way of working, so you can improve the idea first. And then validate it when you actually made something."
74,2022-11-17T15:29:03.496000+00:00,"It's better to focus on one of these first, not try and do two at once."
75,2022-11-17T15:18:12.073000+00:00,Have you already designed this idea in something tangible?
76,2022-11-17T15:13:30.479000+00:00,"both. validate this as an idea , and gain understand their way of working , and plus how to people could use this platform / product to improve their way to progress"
77,2022-11-17T15:11:39.359000+00:00,"Alright, so to make sure I understand. Your idea is to join all 3, sort of a platform. 

Then are you looking to validate this as an idea?

Or are you looking to gain understanding their way of working? (in order the further improve the idea)"
78,2022-11-17T15:06:40.541000+00:00,"it's a thing I am trying to figure out how to join all 3 , and reformat the way to do it with more insightful way"
79,2022-11-17T15:03:40.203000+00:00,Ahh so it's a current thing they're already doing and you want insight in that?
80,2022-11-17T14:59:39.233000+00:00,"I am expecting to get answers what progress dietitians follows to measure or track the body from clients , which data matter more regarding to body progress , and dietary analysis . and from users . food recod / workout / nutrition records / measures / performance about their body progress,  how they reports , tracks , and which data are more import from 3 aspects ( dietitian from personal trainers , and from dietitian to client )"
81,2022-11-17T14:53:31.639000+00:00,It's the exact opposite basically.
82,2022-11-17T14:52:23.430000+00:00,"The problem is that this is basically a ""How Might We"" question. It's function is not to investigate, it's to ideate. You don't ask the user to brainstorm for you, that's your job."
83,2022-11-17T14:50:26.904000+00:00,What would you hope to achieve by asking that to the user?
84,2022-11-17T14:49:54.627000+00:00,users
85,2022-11-17T14:49:38.520000+00:00,Narrow questions to whom?
86,2022-11-17T14:49:17.941000+00:00,how can I narrow questions regarding to `What are ways fitness studios team or partner up with nutrition coaches?` ?
87,2022-11-17T14:48:53.411000+00:00,Fun video about it
88,2022-11-17T14:48:49.242000+00:00,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hla1jzhan78
89,2022-11-17T14:47:17.514000+00:00,"That's a question for you, not for the user."
90,2022-11-17T14:46:53.536000+00:00,trying to ask a question as a general and focused question like this `What are ways fitness studios team or partner up with nutrition coaches?` it has a few ways to solve it
91,2022-11-17T14:46:05.901000+00:00,"You don't ask about solutions, you ask about problems. Then it may be possible that personalisation can solve the problem. Then that can be input for a possible design solution, which again you can test to gain more insight."
92,2022-11-17T14:44:35.760000+00:00,"Personalisation is a solution, not a problem."
93,2022-11-17T14:41:57.512000+00:00,how exactly can I extract more information about personalization or directly or in-directly?
94,2022-11-17T14:41:08.899000+00:00,"Well if you already convinced it's a good idea, then why you're asking?"
95,2022-11-17T14:40:15.966000+00:00,"the another problem. it's narrowing my segment tooo much. e.g athletes , serious people who wants to be fit or enthusiasts who going to be serious , etc"
96,2022-11-17T14:39:54.197000+00:00,in my case would be good idea  dietitian < patient > personal trainer is a great fit
97,2022-11-17T14:38:52.247000+00:00,"Yeah, they'll tell you. But the problem is they don;t have a clue what they want. They just speak out of their ass. They'll tell you they want to include their favorite people, and then when you make it they'll tell you it's a bad idea."
98,2022-11-17T14:37:22.758000+00:00,"I mean personalization as a way to `lets say I want to include my favorite people who I trust on , and another too` similar to a collaborative platform"
99,2022-11-17T14:34:20.901000+00:00,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIiAAhUeR6Y
100,2022-11-17T14:34:00.301000+00:00,There's a good ted video about this
101,2022-11-17T14:33:43.234000+00:00,Thus they want you to personalize their experience without collecting personalized data
102,2022-11-17T14:32:57.518000+00:00,"They will tell you ""I want personalisation"", next they will tell you ""I don't want to share my data!"""
103,2022-11-17T14:32:37.103000+00:00,Or about personalisation
104,2022-11-17T14:31:31.313000+00:00,Even though 80% of coffee lovers will tell you about their dark roast
105,2022-11-17T14:31:17.763000+00:00,Which is why starbucks works
106,2022-11-17T14:31:10.755000+00:00,Though the reality is the most people just want milky sweet coffee
107,2022-11-17T14:30:57.462000+00:00,Where most people interviewed will tell you they want dark coffee
108,2022-11-17T14:30:22.252000+00:00,A good example is coffee
109,2022-11-17T14:30:11.775000+00:00,Companies have lost millions/billions by doing what costumers said ü•≤
110,2022-11-17T14:28:34.082000+00:00,"However, one thing you can ask for is the desired result, rather than the solution"
111,2022-11-17T14:28:14.249000+00:00,"Well you can't. That is a designers role. You can only ask them about the problem, not the solution."
112,2022-11-17T14:27:21.343000+00:00,"As in solutions to improve communication channels, and personalization?"
113,2022-11-17T14:19:12.611000+00:00,"<@209640428151111680> how can I ask questions about how to get answers like how to improve communication channels, workflow, and personalization?"

115,2022-11-17T13:54:36.536000+00:00,These are Wicked Problems
116,2022-11-17T13:54:11.149000+00:00,"I guess there are multiple directions

A simple one would just to choose an existing website. THis is a very practical way, as you don't need to worry about the design. You can practice your skills like usability research with a practical example. You can still define your target a little differently. For example, researching some the use of popular app (whatsApp) for specific use case. Like in business. Because it's easier to find issues then.

Another is more abstract, and therefore more difficult / advanced. To really research a specific problem. Specifically 'wicked' problems, like fast fashion consumption, recycling, etc. For this there isn't really a product. More a behaviour, like splitting trash."
117,2022-11-17T13:13:57.935000+00:00,Just research for now
118,2022-11-17T13:06:23.974000+00:00,"Is it purely research, or also design?"
119,2022-11-17T12:57:20.324000+00:00,"Hello everyone! üëã  I'd like to build up a UX research project on my own so I'd really love to hear any tips or advice you have on how to start, where, how to do it as a side project for myself. Thank you in advance! üòä"
120,2022-11-17T08:40:39.052000+00:00,And you'll have your research questions like magic
121,2022-11-17T08:40:30.099000+00:00,Then you simply re-write the goals as questions
122,2022-11-17T08:39:17.083000+00:00,"So when conflicting goals happen, this is good to take inaccount"
123,2022-11-17T08:38:41.733000+00:00,Take in mind stakeholders may have conflicting goals
124,2022-11-17T08:38:25.141000+00:00,"Some questions that may help:

- In terms of what you do on a day to day basis, what are the goals of the product?
- Are there any ways that it's not meeting those goals?
- Are there questions you want to have answered about it?"

130,2022-11-15T21:40:42.671000+00:00,"Ahoy hoy all, I'm currently ending a UX/UI design apprenticeship with a not so new start up (they've been around 8 years now) and throughout the year, I've had to self study because our lead is not an industry pro and wasn't able to help at all. I've been recently transferred to a ""Solutions Engineer"" apprenticeship and they're teaching us how to do ""Discovery"" meetings with stakeholders. Does anyone have experience or resources or advice on how one goes about conducting different types of interviews with stakeholders? Sorry if this is text heavy but I'm open to discussion and just looking for a little help outside of this particular company. They seem to have their own way of doing things that aren't industry standards."
131,2022-11-15T20:35:41.297000+00:00,"Hey all, can anyone recommend a good online course to take for user research? My company is doing something where people work on outside stuff for two weeks as long as it benefits the company in some way lol so I suggested I take a course on user research for those two weeks."
132,2022-11-14T20:36:28.525000+00:00,"Oh, sorry about it."
133,2022-11-14T20:21:42.603000+00:00,"<@209640428151111680> how can I ask questions about how to get answers like how to improve communication channels, workflow, and personalization ?"
134,2022-11-14T19:56:44.238000+00:00,ask your friends and family
135,2022-11-14T19:56:41.756000+00:00,"also, dont recruit UX people. they arent representative of most users because they're trained in administering this sort of research."
136,2022-11-14T19:56:27.545000+00:00,Not a recruitment channel
137,2022-11-14T17:47:28.898000+00:00,<@209640428151111680>  I updated the doc https://docs.google.com/document/d/1UqyrooNWsYrHEDhBPxQF39m0SAENMsaxxhpMsabI6cQ/edit
138,2022-11-13T14:58:44.593000+00:00,"Open questions: Can you tell us more about X?
Descriptive questions: How does a day look for you?
Informational questions: how, what, where, when, who, why
Example questions: Can you give an example?
Contrast questions: How do brand X products compare to brand Y products for you?"
139,2022-11-13T14:58:08.817000+00:00,For types of questions think of
140,2022-11-13T14:51:21.055000+00:00,"E.g
- Could you tell me something about your way of working when doing dietary analysis? 
   - What is the most difficult part?
   - What is the most easy part?
>
- Could you tell me the different steps involved when doing dietary analysis?
   - In which order are those steps?
   - Are they always in the same order?
>
- What are the different tools you're using during dietary analysis?
   - Could you tell me more about tool X?
     - What was the last time you used it for?
   - Could you tell me more about tool Y?
    - What was the last time you used it for?
   - Etc etc
>"
141,2022-11-13T14:46:20.552000+00:00,"Where you start by very big wide questions, and make them more specific the more you go down in the funnel"
142,2022-11-13T14:43:27.158000+00:00,Then a strategy of questions is to work in funnel shapes
143,2022-11-13T14:42:50.450000+00:00,"For example:
Dietary analysis
- steps of dietary analysis
- tools used
- pains gains in current way of working 
- etc
-"
144,2022-11-13T14:38:32.031000+00:00,Then make multiple questions for each
145,2022-11-13T14:37:43.748000+00:00,Then pull those topics further apart
146,2022-11-13T14:15:57.360000+00:00,Well start with those themes / topics you got
147,2022-11-13T14:11:22.305000+00:00,"of course, but I am not sure how to organize them , and some of them are from my survey <@209640428151111680>"
148,2022-11-13T07:35:12.221000+00:00,"I only see an introduction, you haven‚Äôt got any questions yet?"
149,2022-11-13T01:05:58.961000+00:00,"<@209640428151111680>  I am trying to build an interview guide https://docs.google.com/document/d/1UqyrooNWsYrHEDhBPxQF39m0SAENMsaxxhpMsabI6cQ/edit?usp=sharing , and this is what I got so far, my topic it's been narrowed to sport and exercise nutrition focusing on the following topics `dietary analysis, nutrition counseling and education, estimating body composition.`"
150,2022-11-12T21:05:51.273000+00:00,good point
151,2022-11-12T20:39:50.956000+00:00,<@209640428151111680> do you consider adding an expert interview and survey end user  to better insights about my idea?
152,2022-11-12T20:02:13.182000+00:00,"Point being that a bad review is just a symptom of a problem, not the problem"
153,2022-11-12T20:01:17.758000+00:00,"Maybe less, maybe more"
154,2022-11-12T20:01:08.786000+00:00,"Well I just made those percentages up, they‚Äôre not really at that proportion"
155,2022-11-12T19:49:49.384000+00:00,Thanks Dario! That‚Äôs good to know
156,2022-11-12T17:40:28.760000+00:00,"of course, but you have at least 5% who does."
157,2022-11-12T11:12:10.213000+00:00,"However, when it's something you're not familiar with at all, the 'jargon' of the subject may differ a lot. Using the wrong jargon will not give you any hits."
158,2022-11-12T11:11:17.056000+00:00,"A lot of deskresearch depends on how well you know the buzzterms of the subject. For example, doing research to UX you know the buzzterms like: IA, Interaction Design, Progressive / staged disclosure, etc etc"
159,2022-11-12T11:09:41.578000+00:00,One little thing I usually do before secondary research is first do research for key or buzz terms within the subject.
160,2022-11-12T11:02:58.761000+00:00,"Reviews are never really 'pains' too. 80% are bug reports, and the other 20% are frustrated users, that sadly won't exactly tell you why they're frustrated"
161,2022-11-12T11:01:49.614000+00:00,I guess even reading reviews is more effectively done with R or Python
162,2022-11-12T10:57:05.677000+00:00,"Twitter has an open API for R too, so you can analyse all live twitter posts of any user"
163,2022-11-12T09:40:26.887000+00:00,observation in natural digital setting without a controlled environment‚Ä¶maybe a researcher is taking notes on the live spiel over at Twitter rn üôÉ
164,2022-11-12T09:37:33.560000+00:00,agree ish- mainly called digital ethnography some just observe in the background
165,2022-11-12T06:00:33.548000+00:00,Thank you!! Will definitely check these out
166,2022-11-11T23:11:58.839000+00:00,"Hey guys! What's up?
Do you have any advice on how to carry **literature research / secondary research**? I'm mainly looking for methodological advices  and good practices 
(they asked me  to teach others but I see i have many gaps on the subject)"
167,2022-11-11T20:06:29.929000+00:00,"Lookback for things like remote usability research, concept tests and interviews.

Usabilityhub and Maze for quantitative usability testing.

Optimal workshop for cardsorting and tree test.

Alchemer for surveys.

Dovetail or Codens for research repositories"
168,2022-11-11T15:57:00.493000+00:00,oh I see. reading reviews and forums still needs to talk with your users
169,2022-11-11T15:54:35.029000+00:00,what do you mean by?
170,2022-11-11T14:59:24.802000+00:00,"Hi everyone! 

I just landed my first job and one of my first tasks is to suggest UX research tools and softwares that the company might need to buy. They have an established design dept but I'm the first research hire. 

Please share the tools that are used in your organisations, or you personally use. Help me create a good first impression pls <:0_jz_yikes:849183585625440258>"
171,2022-11-11T11:58:46.385000+00:00,"This is also a reframing activity. Where the blue box stands for current products, however deconstructucted. Competitors for example. The green stands for a new product in that sense"
172,2022-11-11T11:52:48.298000+00:00,"This is also a method designed by industrial product designers, rather than digital product designers"
173,2022-11-11T11:51:44.738000+00:00,"1. Design is about looking for possibilities, and possible futures, instead of solving
present-day problems.
2. Products are a means of accomplishing appropriate actions, interactions, and
relationships. In interaction with people, products obtain their meaning. This is
why ViP is interaction-centred.
3. The appropriateness of an interaction is determined by the context for which it
is designed. This context can be the world of today, tomorrow, or may lie years
ahead. Future contexts demand new and different behaviours. This makes ViP
context-driven."
174,2022-11-11T11:51:41.584000+00:00,"To get some beginning context about the method, these are some of the assumptions the method makes:"
175,2022-11-11T11:51:00.197000+00:00,Where the focus is on the expert as 'designer'. While UX research is often more user-led. This method is design-led.
176,2022-11-11T11:50:42.664000+00:00,This is an older model of research though
177,2022-11-11T11:47:30.785000+00:00,Part of it you have already done
178,2022-11-11T11:43:55.473000+00:00,If you want to get some more context

182,2022-11-11T11:35:09.837000+00:00,Which is complete desk research and product innovation method
183,2022-11-11T11:35:03.771000+00:00,One thing you could try is VIP analysis
184,2022-11-11T06:23:53.982000+00:00,Not wanting to touch users when doing ux research is like not wanting to touch code when doing development
185,2022-11-11T06:13:55.283000+00:00,"UX research is build around talking to users. 

If doing interviews is like swimming in the ocean, reading reviews and forums is like dipping your little toe in the water."
186,2022-11-11T06:02:30.503000+00:00,"Well in theory it isn‚Äôt, because they‚Äôre not users"
187,2022-11-11T05:41:16.680000+00:00,Unless you can make a really cheap MVP I think the idea is that it's usually worth the upfront investment to get some stronger validation for the product first before developing it
188,2022-11-11T05:18:51.884000+00:00,ethnographic is still a user research
189,2022-11-11T05:17:12.402000+00:00,what do you mean is going to be 1000 times as expensive? do you mean the coding part?
190,2022-11-10T22:27:03.177000+00:00,If it‚Äôs an app people may get irritated
191,2022-11-10T22:26:52.735000+00:00,If it‚Äôs a plane people will die
192,2022-11-10T22:26:42.900000+00:00,Depends how risky the product is
193,2022-11-10T22:25:13.840000+00:00,And even more unlucky it will blow up
194,2022-11-10T22:24:59.833000+00:00,And if you‚Äôre unlucky it‚Äôs a square wheel
195,2022-11-10T22:24:40.238000+00:00,Just a bit more kinks in the wheels
196,2022-11-10T22:23:33.319000+00:00,Which can work fine
197,2022-11-10T22:23:07.342000+00:00,Bit of a head first approach
198,2022-11-10T22:21:21.646000+00:00,"But also the most risky, because you need to go back and fix it"
199,2022-11-10T22:21:02.624000+00:00,In theory just launching is the best research you can possibly get
200,2022-11-10T22:14:35.574000+00:00,Doesn‚Äôt mean you can‚Äôt make money if you don‚Äôt do research
201,2022-11-10T22:14:11.169000+00:00,"Sort of yeah, changing things after a MVP launch is going to be 1000 times as expensive as paying a researcher so it wouldn‚Äôt have been in the launch in the first place"
202,2022-11-10T21:28:37.972000+00:00,should be done before MVP? <@209640428151111680>
203,2022-11-10T21:28:21.091000+00:00,"not exactly a product fit market, but you can start off from that and build an MVP and later with it's running the platform with sales , then you can re-invest the sales into interviews, and more stuff"
204,2022-11-10T21:26:17.995000+00:00,"Well no, you need to talk to users if you want to know the fit. Doing online analysis is maybe just good enough for a hypothesis"
205,2022-11-10T21:12:32.544000+00:00,<@209640428151111680>
206,2022-11-10T21:12:29.039000+00:00,"all my research is based on ethnography methology , but if we take back to real world projects. can this approach still create solid product market fit ??"
207,2022-11-10T21:11:57.356000+00:00,https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_ethnography
208,2022-11-10T21:11:08.849000+00:00,Google around for online ethnography research methods
209,2022-11-10T21:10:57.841000+00:00,What you mean is still sort of ethnographic research
210,2022-11-10T21:10:38.769000+00:00,But focus group in research terms is a technique with a group of people in a room and one researcher controlling the conversation
211,2022-11-10T21:10:02.190000+00:00,"exactly. a segment of people with an interest , and this case designers"
212,2022-11-10T21:09:32.398000+00:00,"Or group like design buddies, a group with designers"
213,2022-11-10T21:09:09.032000+00:00,What you mean is a forum?
214,2022-11-10T21:08:41.261000+00:00,A focus group is basically a group interview
215,2022-11-10T20:59:38.367000+00:00,"a group of people with a common interest. e.g. Facebook group about not-sure people who like to hike or surf, etc. I think that group would place into focus group."
216,2022-11-10T17:33:56.470000+00:00,What do you think a focus group is?
217,2022-11-10T16:45:41.740000+00:00,"what methods would you use this case? 

- monitor forums, reviews 
- surveys 
- research papers, articles, reports
- focus group e..g people where usually hang out
- what else?"
218,2022-11-10T16:44:25.696000+00:00,I dont want to delete user research ; however I want to create a product and lower costs and once it's running perform or going full budget with all methods
219,2022-11-10T16:43:33.575000+00:00,"of course, but observer users act more naturally"
220,2022-11-10T16:43:24.877000+00:00,"Eitherway, you can still create product without user research."
221,2022-11-10T16:40:32.701000+00:00,User research requires users
222,2022-11-10T16:40:22.676000+00:00,There's no alternative to talk to someone
223,2022-11-10T16:40:06.314000+00:00,Sadly the only alternative for paid interviews is hustling for free interviews
224,2022-11-10T16:39:11.947000+00:00,an example?
225,2022-11-10T16:38:52.715000+00:00,can you say it's a great resource when you don't have a budget for interviews and still want to create a product ?
226,2022-11-10T12:14:47.479000+00:00,"Hi everyone!

I am currently part of a UX Research Challenge project focused on how to attain a healthy and active lifestyle. This 5-minute survey is to better understand you as an individual and your preferences/desires to attain a healthy lifestyle. 
We are targeting ALL individuals (globally) to understand their pain points. I appreciate any and all responses!

https://lnkd.in/esfCF6xm"
227,2022-11-10T12:04:13.571000+00:00,"interesting, yeah now that i think about it e-commerce does need to cater to a lot of different needs and use cases in comparison to some other experiences that might be more streamlined

funnily enough delivery and fulfilment expectations are some of the bigger issues we're trying to tackle"
228,2022-11-10T11:44:05.142000+00:00,Also rural area and city area can play big effects in delivery expectations
229,2022-11-10T11:43:47.105000+00:00,"I guess what often has a big influence in e-commerce is also the frequency of buying online products. If you take Amazon for example, most people have used Amazon before. However, there are some users who use Amazon for all e-commerce purchases, which is the target for amazon prime. Which is a different kind of user, even though they're both users."
230,2022-11-10T11:41:46.472000+00:00,"Ahh for e-commerce there's some differences too! Often we try and recruit them by stating ""Has bought something at X in the last three months"""
231,2022-11-10T11:17:34.539000+00:00,"thanks, good insights üôÇ for context i'm helping do some research for an ecomm site and we opened up recruitment to anyone as long as they were purchasing the same kinds of products

as a result the discussion guide does lean a bit more towards market research and more general user needs , so it got me thinking about users vs non users"
232,2022-11-10T06:38:34.633000+00:00,"So I suppose if your goal is growing the user base, then non users become the subject of research"
233,2022-11-10T06:34:34.839000+00:00,Some even go so far to only ever research super users.
234,2022-11-10T06:33:41.679000+00:00,"It depends on the context. What exactly is being researched. For example, a new product wouldn‚Äôt have any users.

But also value propositions, in the aim to gain more users, to see what the barriers and gains are of use. This is more towards market research.

The biggest con is that if they‚Äôre users, you can be 100% sure they are the target demographic. If they‚Äôre not the user, you need to guess whether they‚Äôre ‚Äòpotential‚Äô users, which is very arbitrary and likely to be wrong."
235,2022-11-10T02:38:30.363000+00:00,"any thoughts regarding doing research on non-users (but within target demographic) VS existing users? just wondering how others might approach it, whether you don't test non-users at all, or will test them to understand something you can't get from existing users, etc."
236,2022-11-08T15:08:47.470000+00:00,"Hello <@829918297998491648>, please move your post to <#708809627260944436>. Thank you."
237,2022-11-07T22:27:53.160000+00:00,Because it‚Äôs more a controlled situation in that sense
238,2022-11-07T22:27:36.825000+00:00,Interviewing falls under lab research
239,2022-11-07T22:23:34.368000+00:00,"One isn‚Äôt an alternative to the other one exactly either, it‚Äôs more a triangulation of observation"
240,2022-11-07T22:22:50.518000+00:00,Looking at a forum for interaction is more like a field visit but digital
241,2022-11-07T22:22:29.492000+00:00,So for it being an alternative it still needs to have the same observation role
242,2022-11-07T22:21:54.176000+00:00,https://measuringu.com/observation-role/
243,2022-11-07T22:20:28.857000+00:00,One is naturalistic (ethnography) the other more controlled
244,2022-11-07T22:19:39.432000+00:00,With interviews there‚Äôs interaction with the person that is being researched
245,2022-11-07T22:19:08.542000+00:00,"No, they‚Äôre different forms of research. Looking at forums or product reviews is ethnography (online ethnography), it‚Äôs a method of observing interactions"
246,2022-11-07T21:15:39.599000+00:00,one more question. can you compare reviewing forums or product reviews vs interviews ( cost money )  as an alternative with the same value( slow and overwhelming )?
247,2022-11-07T21:00:21.434000+00:00,And UX research is far from being as scrying orb
248,2022-11-07T20:59:00.622000+00:00,You will then be liable when you‚Äôre wrong
249,2022-11-07T20:58:21.269000+00:00,It‚Äôs a very dangerous game to try and prove too
250,2022-11-07T20:51:25.622000+00:00,One thing to be mindful of about ux research is that we don't use it to confirm or prove anything. It's a means of **supporting **decisions based on data!
251,2022-11-07T20:32:04.264000+00:00,an interview as a form of confirmatory theory <@209640428151111680>
252,2022-11-07T20:16:23.952000+00:00,If you post that interview guide in here I can give feedback on the questions if you wish
253,2022-11-07T20:15:55.634000+00:00,So basically as food for brainstorming
254,2022-11-07T20:15:37.055000+00:00,"And aim to validate / dig further into those, based on that earlier research"
255,2022-11-07T20:15:12.319000+00:00,Map down your ‚Äòassumptions‚Äô based on the research in that sense
256,2022-11-07T20:14:27.201000+00:00,"Then try and write an interview guide, using what you‚Äôve learned in the previous research"
257,2022-11-07T20:01:08.766000+00:00,"no interviews, but I did like this<@209640428151111680>"

270,2022-11-07T19:25:40.309000+00:00,Don't you want to learn how to conduct them instead?
271,2022-11-07T19:24:59.919000+00:00,this is what I want to learn how to use each research methods based on what scenarios . do you have an article or course about it?
272,2022-11-07T19:23:10.967000+00:00,This is an A/B test
273,2022-11-07T19:22:59.171000+00:00,"It would be usability testing, not A/B testing."
274,2022-11-07T19:21:41.380000+00:00,Why you're playing method Quiz?
275,2022-11-07T19:21:25.168000+00:00,this can be usability testing or A/B
276,2022-11-07T19:20:28.795000+00:00,"Why not try and tackle some like ""How can I increase the base usability of product X?'"
277,2022-11-07T19:20:00.980000+00:00,Yeah but you seem to be getting ahead of yourself. You're asking how to do a backflip on a bicycle when you haven't learned to ride in a straight line yet.
278,2022-11-07T19:18:55.310000+00:00,I was meaning with those statements which user research to use based on that
279,2022-11-07T19:18:41.487000+00:00,Maybe first try and tackle a simple and concrete question first
280,2022-11-07T19:17:23.284000+00:00,The questions you state require you to have some research knowledge first
281,2022-11-07T19:16:04.116000+00:00,"I'd take a few steps back first, and learn what quantitative > qualitative means. Behavioural > attitudinal"

283,2022-11-07T19:14:27.245000+00:00,(which is why surveys tend to not be easy)
284,2022-11-07T19:12:58.104000+00:00,But those are indeed conducted through quantitative data

286,2022-11-07T19:10:10.330000+00:00,Those are effects. Hypothesis testing looks like this (specifically a T-test)
287,2022-11-07T19:02:39.258000+00:00,"measure something or test a hypothesis , and  try new ideas, thoughts and meanings qualitative . that's what I have been taught from google"
288,2022-11-07T18:57:15.847000+00:00,What's the difference between 'why' and understanding 'context' you're stating?

295,2022-11-07T18:47:51.665000+00:00,The second one. There are two keys points here. The budget is 'small' and you want 'as much data as possible'. If the budget is small there isn't going to be money for more than one method.
296,2022-11-07T18:42:12.005000+00:00,"e..g the second one . I would use an analysis of competitors' user views finding missing features and bad reviews, forums about the topic, and apps, the comparative analysis then a survey to check my theory once you have a basic MVP interview to model your product / leading to the right path.

347,2022-11-03T19:20:14.652000+00:00,How is this experience affecting their word-of-mouth marketing? Market research
348,2022-11-03T19:19:05.994000+00:00,How are the current user currently experiencing this product? UX Research
349,2022-11-03T19:18:49.296000+00:00,What are the other potential users for this product? Market research.
350,2022-11-03T19:18:29.783000+00:00,How much would users then pay for that product? Would be more towards market research.
351,2022-11-03T19:18:14.283000+00:00,Building a product and doing usability testing is definitely UX Research. Because we're concerned with the subjective experience of the product.
352,2022-11-03T19:16:56.407000+00:00,"So with your examples, you can see there's a lot of market focus."
353,2022-11-03T19:16:38.958000+00:00,"Well, I suppose the process of research itself isn't very different. Except that one usually is intertwined with designers and the other is not.

Generally you could say the goal is slightly different. In market research we are interested in the 'market'. So this also scopes in any potential users, rather than just current user. While in UX research we're interested in the product as 'tool'. And generally we want to to test with 'real' users.

With product market fit this becomes a bit more complex, because here market and product are essentially intertwined."

3. market share,  size, volumen , and growing yearly

358,2022-11-03T18:49:31.467000+00:00,I imagine you mean the difference of ux research and market research?
359,2022-11-03T18:19:20.277000+00:00,can anyone explain to me the real difference between Market Research for Product Development vs product market fit?

373,2022-11-02T14:28:13.656000+00:00,"One of the big functions of a research plan isn't actually planning it (I suppose it is to some extent), its function is to communicate it"
374,2022-11-02T14:27:06.981000+00:00,Depends how small 'small' is
375,2022-11-02T14:14:40.223000+00:00,Do you usually create a research plan even for small research activities like Content Testing?
376,2022-11-01T07:51:27.230000+00:00,"For one interview we had real-estate agents, one said ""I don't get out of bed for less than a million"" (the home price), still they joined the research for a 30 euro gift card for 45 minutes of their time."
377,2022-11-01T07:49:30.839000+00:00,This may be different per culture though. So you're the best judge of what's considered 'proper' in your own culture.
378,2022-11-01T07:44:39.087000+00:00,The incentive is up to you. If you want to give 100 - 200 for each respondent that's sometimes done as well.
379,2022-11-01T07:40:16.753000+00:00,"Not really. It isn't about the money, it's just a formality basically. That's why it's a giftcard and not hard cash. Otherwise we could make a really good paying job that's just about joining research."
380,2022-11-01T03:25:46.528000+00:00,"I think less than their session cost would be an insult , wouldnt I?"
381,2022-11-01T03:23:38.634000+00:00,that's aprox a session patient üòÖ
382,2022-10-31T12:33:30.965000+00:00,"Hello <@680292921504956483>, please move your post to <#708809627260944436>. Thank you."
383,2022-10-31T06:49:46.939000+00:00,"For incentive it always depends. If remote 30 euro is usually enough, a gift card or something.

With less money you can also offer more hedonic incentives. Depending on what would be interesting to dieticians"
384,2022-10-31T06:46:34.341000+00:00,"Or well, 5 of each group you want to talk too"
385,2022-10-31T06:42:12.832000+00:00,5 dietitian‚Äôs should be enough
386,2022-10-30T22:59:07.297000+00:00,How many expert field do I need to interview?
387,2022-10-30T22:58:45.578000+00:00,How kind of incentive should I give for each user interview?
388,2022-10-30T22:04:58.447000+00:00,Oh I see . If I need to interview dietitians maybe 1 to 5 or 10 . Should I pay them as a patient? ü§î
389,2022-10-30T18:31:48.511000+00:00,To see if there‚Äôs some hci accessibility principles too
390,2022-10-30T18:31:01.108000+00:00,Yeah! Also do some googling on scholar

395,2022-10-30T18:27:06.858000+00:00,Just the standard WCAG checklist
396,2022-10-30T16:33:45.835000+00:00,"Hi @everyone
I'm working on e-commerce project where the client want to test some different discount presentations for Black Friday and they want to stay away from red. 

Can you share some resources where I can check what colours are most used for Black Friday (I assume its mostly black and red) and how the discounts are presented on websites (banners, buttons, popup etc.). Thank you"
397,2022-10-30T15:42:22.993000+00:00,"It might be linked (maybe hidden and I cannot find it atm) already, but is there a general outline of what kind of things go into an accessibility/UX audit? Like the ones they do at larger companies or the things that cost 5k to 50k+ to have done."
398,2022-10-30T13:54:31.036000+00:00,"Basically if you talk about someone way of working you can do it the same way. This allows more explorative insights, without losing the focus of where you want to go eventually"
399,2022-10-30T13:53:55.128000+00:00,"You then want to zoom in even more ""Could I see the TV?"""
400,2022-10-30T13:53:10.776000+00:00,"Then you say ""Could I see the living room?"" ""Could I see the bathroom?"" ""Could I see the cellar?"""
401,2022-10-30T13:52:35.048000+00:00,Because they will show you what they think is important
402,2022-10-30T13:52:27.443000+00:00,"First you ask ""Can you show me the house?"""
403,2022-10-30T13:52:19.339000+00:00,Basically an interview is like going to someones house
404,2022-10-30T13:51:44.233000+00:00,https://jan.ucc.nau.edu/~pms/cj355/readings/spradley.pdf
405,2022-10-30T13:51:43.425000+00:00,"If you want some theory based on this read the grand tour, small tour technique from anthropology"
406,2022-10-30T13:48:47.019000+00:00,"To be able to write a lot of questions think in funnels, start wide and go more specific step by step"
407,2022-10-30T13:48:12.988000+00:00,"However, maybe they also tell you things that are important to ensure that process goes well. Those could be 'needs'"
408,2022-10-30T13:47:15.763000+00:00,Those are 'pains'
409,2022-10-30T13:47:11.679000+00:00,The aim is to get someone to remember their process but more interesting than the process are moments this process could have been more effective
410,2022-10-30T13:44:34.178000+00:00,"Basically, you mainly talk about someones process"
411,2022-10-30T13:44:24.869000+00:00,"Can you tell me something about your process for assessing a client's nutritional needs?
- What do you start with?
   - Why do you start with this step?
- What do you end with?
   - Why do you end with this step? 
- To which extent is it always in this order?
- How was this process with your last client?
- What went well?
- What could be better?
   - Why could that be better?
   - How did you solve that problem?

Etc etc"
412,2022-10-30T13:41:00.795000+00:00,Example:
413,2022-10-30T13:40:40.915000+00:00,What you're trying isn't possible with a survey
414,2022-10-30T13:40:24.962000+00:00,"Yeah, write some questions in a word document. Or try and create an interview guide."
415,2022-10-30T06:14:59.478000+00:00,I guess he means writing an interview guide and share it here to get feedback
416,2022-10-30T02:57:42.845000+00:00,"Hello <@311340207574089738>, please move your post to <#708809627260944436>. Thank you."
417,2022-10-29T18:34:06.610000+00:00,ooo thanks didn't think of this! i'll give it a shot and see how it looks <:FrogOk:851335403985960960>
418,2022-10-29T17:19:02.703000+00:00,what do you mean?
419,2022-10-29T17:08:22.463000+00:00,"See if you can make it in a word document, then you can share it in here if you wish"
420,2022-10-29T17:07:43.656000+00:00,"Well with a survey you can't. It's like eating soup with a fork.

But for interviews I'd look up: https://www.nngroup.com/articles/interview-guide/"
421,2022-10-29T17:01:00.424000+00:00,Both if possible
422,2022-10-29T17:00:42.181000+00:00,"An interview is not a survey. Though, you're asking how you'd get to needs and pains using an interview technique?"
423,2022-10-29T16:50:25.877000+00:00,"Sure, but an interview is also a survey , how would you get ‚Äúneeds‚Äù and ‚Äúpains‚Äù ?"
424,2022-10-29T16:49:19.215000+00:00,"Easy to do it , and scary doing it üòÖ"
425,2022-10-29T16:48:12.029000+00:00,Why do you want it to be a survey?
426,2022-10-29T16:46:47.545000+00:00,You'd use the survey to get people to face to face interviews
427,2022-10-29T16:44:53.913000+00:00,Example how would you do it in order to collect needs or pains?
428,2022-10-29T16:40:16.732000+00:00,For needs.
429,2022-10-29T16:40:12.130000+00:00,How can I improve this survey?
430,2022-10-29T16:36:32.534000+00:00,But they're not 'needs' or 'pains'
431,2022-10-29T16:36:10.065000+00:00,Can be useful
432,2022-10-29T16:36:01.695000+00:00,"For example:

""Which of the following nutrition-related data metrics do you collect for your patient goals?""

or

""What kind of diet tracking methods would you use with your clients?"""
433,2022-10-29T16:34:51.007000+00:00,Only for the behavioural questions
434,2022-10-29T16:34:39.960000+00:00,"The answer here is not important, but the reason why they think that answer is the right answer is"
435,2022-10-29T16:34:19.534000+00:00,"That‚Äôs true , but can I use this primary survey to support product fit?"
436,2022-10-29T16:34:10.131000+00:00,"""What aspects of nutrition do you think are most important to address when consulting with clients?"""
437,2022-10-29T16:34:07.428000+00:00,For example
438,2022-10-29T16:33:28.588000+00:00,"It's not interesting what they say, but why they say. And to be able to know that you beed to be able to say ""Why do you give that answer?"""
439,2022-10-29T16:32:54.499000+00:00,Their answer will still be an attribute
440,2022-10-29T16:32:39.381000+00:00,That doesn't matter
441,2022-10-29T16:32:31.729000+00:00,The survey was open ended questions
442,2022-10-29T16:31:25.411000+00:00,(if those needs are alrready known)
443,2022-10-29T16:31:18.940000+00:00,Or segmentations of which groups tie in with which needs
444,2022-10-29T16:30:26.955000+00:00,Surveys can only give you attributes
445,2022-10-29T16:30:21.372000+00:00,
446,2022-10-29T16:30:01.179000+00:00,It's means to end theory
447,2022-10-29T16:27:22.861000+00:00,"You don't find 'needs' with survey in that sense, even if you ask a 1000000 people"
448,2022-10-29T16:25:49.145000+00:00,A survey is more interesting if you want to know which demographics correlate with which specific pains / gains
449,2022-10-29T16:25:01.585000+00:00,You do interviews
450,2022-10-29T16:24:54.393000+00:00,Well you don't use surveys for that
451,2022-10-29T16:24:42.745000+00:00,"How do I need to theme each question response e.g products and services, pain relievers etc?"
452,2022-10-29T16:23:47.553000+00:00,"Sure , but in order to create this . I need to find needs from qualitative survey"
453,2022-10-29T16:22:20.050000+00:00,
454,2022-10-29T16:22:17.061000+00:00,Based on a value proposition
455,2022-10-29T16:21:06.528000+00:00,"Well with a product market fit there's already a set of themes you can use; so closed coding rather than open coding. Where you want to analyse the tasks (jobs to be done), pains or barriers when performing those tasks, and gains or drivers that make the task more effective"
456,2022-10-29T16:17:25.195000+00:00,Yes
457,2022-10-29T16:16:53.086000+00:00,"Well you're asking ""do I have to theme each question in order to label responses"" in which I assume you mean qualitative coding themes, correct?"
458,2022-10-29T16:07:29.197000+00:00,What do you mean? So product fit market is more about insight data .
459,2022-10-29T16:06:13.203000+00:00,I got 11 expert field and 180+ users where I got 2.6% conversion
460,2022-10-29T07:52:37.506000+00:00,"I very much doubt this kind of survey will answer that question, but I suppose you're not asking feedback on doing surveys"
461,2022-10-29T07:51:42.182000+00:00,"Well since you want to do product market fit, the themes are closed. They're just based on the value prop > JTBD, Pain, Gain

So you what is your process, what kind of tracking, which metrics are all input for further JTBD research"
462,2022-10-29T07:07:04.973000+00:00,<@209640428151111680> do I need to label / theme each response to fit its own category to futher use into a product/service?

486,2022-10-23T18:58:09.474000+00:00,Or be good at statistics

497,2022-10-21T05:42:30.968000+00:00,Yea. Probably ergonomics and statistics are top of head items.
498,2022-10-21T05:27:56.602000+00:00,Well kind of depends. Generally mostly behavioural sciences.
499,2022-10-21T05:18:51+00:00,I also wonder how many of my old engineering resources actually apply to the research side of UX

525,2022-10-19T12:44:41.593000+00:00,"At this point its mostly usability studies and the friends and family list is pretty short, so I dont really have any choice other than reaching out to strangers. I guess the hustling and reaching people is just something I will have to get good at."
526,2022-10-19T12:42:46.247000+00:00,Then making good decisions is step 2.
527,2022-10-19T12:41:00.007000+00:00,"With strangers you either need money, cookies, or hustling and reaching people directly."
528,2022-10-19T12:40:21.277000+00:00,"And for recruitment for usability test, just start with people close to you. Friends, family."
529,2022-10-19T12:38:44.589000+00:00,"Well. You could start with secondary/desk research. Reading papers, existing case studies etc."
530,2022-10-19T12:36:00.035000+00:00,"Hi! I am trying to become a better designer and struggling with getting real feedback from end users. Posting surveys or reaching out to people cold calling to interview, feels a little spammy. Posting on reddit and reaching out on linkedin has not been as helpful as I had hoped. Would love to hear about what has worked for others and how to reach enough people to make good design decisions based on research."
531,2022-10-19T12:34:18.882000+00:00,I'd really suggest to do an interview instead. Don't do surveys. They don't provide any value for either learning UX research or obtaining data as a beginner. Unless you got the tools to do quant analysis and quant analysis is the thing you're trying to learn.
532,2022-10-19T12:33:06.456000+00:00,"There's a few things...

""Check the features you would like in a to-do list app:"" isn't really a good question to ask. Mainly because the user isn't a designer. Thus asking what they want isn't really valuable. In an interview it might be valuable to ask, because then you can follow up with ""Why is that important to you"" this way you focus on the problem, rather than the solution.

Same with the second question. What they prioritize isn't good data. Only the reasoning of the prioritisation.

Third question does have some value. More a behavioural question. May be better to ask for a range, since it's unlikely they will know the exact number. 

Fourth and fifth questions also aren't fit for a survey. Those are more fit as research questions."

561,2022-10-07T21:29:06.063000+00:00,It also depends on the type of website.
562,2022-10-07T21:26:11.583000+00:00,I‚Äôd make a task oriented test script scoped with the specific test goals / important flows of the specific website

566,2022-10-07T15:46:23.061000+00:00,Meaning the visual presentation of information will always lead whether people read it at all

573,2022-10-07T15:40:50.244000+00:00,A ux portfolio is not an UXR portfolio though
574,2022-10-07T15:38:35.021000+00:00,Not adhering to a professional standard nobody is going to take the research seriously regardless of content
575,2022-10-07T15:37:30.612000+00:00,Especially if you work at a design company.
576,2022-10-07T15:03:35.501000+00:00,"Oh for sure I agree; I think the presentation is another form of communicating the content effectively in a clear and non-distracting manner. I think what I‚Äôm thinking of is that I‚Äôve seen a lot of flashy portfolios that have nice graphic design but have very little substance upon closer inspection lol
agreed on using templates"
577,2022-10-07T14:57:44.299000+00:00,Researchers are not judged on design skills but they are judged on presentation. Use a template that has been designed for you or get help from a designer.
578,2022-10-07T14:51:30.970000+00:00,"I disagree. 

Being a professional researcher means you are adhering to a standard. Professional researchers do not walk into a presentation where they need to present their best self with their insights packaged like a word document with words resized using the excuse ""content matters most.""

The visual presentation of your work will need to meet a professional threshold and is equally important as the content."
579,2022-10-07T14:37:44.487000+00:00,In terms of design for a case study.
580,2022-10-07T14:36:20.628000+00:00,"I think that's the thing that I keep hearing/need to remind myself. I recently had a ux mentor tell me that the design is the wrapping paper - but nobody wants a pretty box that's empty. At the end of the day, content matters most."
581,2022-10-07T14:32:22.825000+00:00,Ah that's great advice - thanks!
582,2022-10-07T14:14:58.414000+00:00,"Definitely prioritize skimmability and surface the key insights visibly; anyone reviewing a bunch of portfolios at the first pass is going to be looking at a page for ~30 seconds (more for later passes if you pass the initial culling) so you want to get the most poignant information across quickly. Show your work, but make the meaty stuff easy to find. Aesthetic cohesion does add professionalism at a glance so it might bump you in that initial impression, but the meat is the highest priority üëç

621,2022-10-05T05:26:14.817000+00:00,That‚Äôs a little different though
622,2022-10-05T05:25:51.757000+00:00,Progressive disclosure is a thing
623,2022-10-05T05:05:30.103000+00:00,"Does this make sense in this context? I'm keeping into account this is relatively easy to do, and not very demanding for older less tech savvy staff I'm talking with"
624,2022-10-05T05:04:47.826000+00:00,"I feel like this could be a relatively low effort workshop with a potential for high impact as I scope out the project more, since I want to redesign with purpose (their initial ask was to revamp the UI since its quite aged)"
625,2022-10-05T05:03:58.335000+00:00,
626,2022-10-05T05:03:20.294000+00:00,"We're still scoping out main needs, constraints, frustrations, etc. that student managers (elected) and school co-op staff encounter when using the application. To help determine main goals, personas, and priorities for a design MVP I wanted to run a workshop similar to this:"
627,2022-10-05T05:02:07.111000+00:00,Hey all! I'm working with an application that allows staff administrators and student housing managers organize tasks (workshifts) for college students living in co-ops (think dorm living in community houses)

631,2022-10-05T02:15:30.038000+00:00,we can call it the cortz effect if no one‚Äôs claimed it yet tho
632,2022-10-05T01:28:20.025000+00:00,Is there an effect that described people preferring results being presented to them all at once in a list rather than swiping through them one at a time
633,2022-10-04T06:46:28.121000+00:00,"Maybe more in the context of concept tests, where you know what you're making will be thrown away"
634,2022-10-04T06:46:06.286000+00:00,But in some cases people rarely make wireframes. I suppose most UX designers have the basic ability that something is at least not completely unusable.
635,2022-10-04T05:52:38.827000+00:00,I guess just focus on the relevant details of what you want to test
636,2022-10-04T05:52:23.178000+00:00,In your case it can be low-if and still have images
637,2022-10-03T23:32:27.323000+00:00,all good points!
638,2022-10-03T23:14:21.667000+00:00,all of the skeleton stuff is taken care of already
639,2022-10-03T23:14:02.625000+00:00,especially as they get more senior or have more robust design systems to work inside
640,2022-10-03T23:13:46.704000+00:00,"with that being said, a lot of designers don't really wireframe"
641,2022-10-03T23:12:53.926000+00:00,that it would be a headache to spend any time caring about high fidelity
642,2022-10-03T23:12:45.757000+00:00,"typically wireframes should never go anywhere near high fidelity, because either what you're working on is so unstable or fluid"
643,2022-10-03T23:11:26.054000+00:00,"what do you need to communicate ->
what's the cheapest thing you can make that communicates what you need to communicate ->
what's the easiest to reuse thing that communicates what you need ->"
644,2022-10-03T23:10:48.186000+00:00,or maybe a misunderstanding of the point of wireframes by somebody in the process
645,2022-10-03T23:10:38.006000+00:00,its kind of a weird misnomer
646,2022-10-03T23:10:33.552000+00:00,all jokes aside
647,2022-10-03T20:15:17.567000+00:00,Let‚Äôs not pretend you don‚Äôt knowüëÄ

649,2022-10-03T19:15:21.062000+00:00,what are high fidelity wireframes <:umcat:908742562347618305>
650,2022-10-03T17:23:46.211000+00:00,The only obvious benefit to low-fi VS high-fi is that off possibly wasted effort if there needs to be a lot of changes. Or short iterations between research and design.
651,2022-10-03T17:19:13.002000+00:00,"Generally it really doesn't matter. Can test it as high-fi as you wish. Especially if you also want to test with images, you can just use high-fi."
652,2022-10-03T16:45:35.547000+00:00,"Hi all, what are your thoughts on conducting usability testing with mid-fi vs hi-fi wireframes? I understand there are advantages to testing with mid-fi, such as to have the user focus on tasks and to reduce effort during iterations. However, I‚Äôm designing a marketing landing page for a software product where I need to test if the user understands what the product features and benefits are based on the content and imagery on the page. In this case, would it be best to test with hi-fi wireframes?"
653,2022-10-01T22:57:19.792000+00:00,"Thank you all this was very valuable information ! I will conduct those usability tests, I have conducted a few before and I‚Äôm more comfortable with those"
654,2022-10-01T06:52:26.747000+00:00,I guess the only obvious con to this method is that you‚Äôre new to research. Thus probably going to end up with a lot of data that you don‚Äôt know what to do with.
655,2022-10-01T06:51:21.352000+00:00,Bit of journey research. So rather how people use the website. You‚Äôll learn how they search. What they actually need. How they evaluate a course. Etc.
656,2022-10-01T06:48:23.791000+00:00,More complex research would then be a Job To Be Done interview. That way you could research how the actual value proposition must change and the utility of the UX rather than the usability.
657,2022-10-01T06:45:40.086000+00:00,However. You say the website is not having a lot of traffic. Changing the usability of an app isn‚Äôt going to influence traffic. Just the bounce rate of what little traffic there currently is.
658,2022-10-01T06:44:07.831000+00:00,"I agree with Lau indeed‚Ä¶

You can just do a usability test. Use the current task of booking a session as the scenario. Think of some multiple tasks that fit in that flow. You can build a tests script of  with that. That way rather than asking what frustration people have felt, you ask what frustration they feel."
659,2022-09-30T23:58:44.091000+00:00,"*Just an assumption* 
But since this is the primary ""job"" of the site, then I'm guessing the desired action is for a potential client to book a tutoring session? So that could be one potential user flow/job to start with. One way to approach this is to do (un)moderated usability testing by writing a scenario, and seeing how potential users would accomplish the desired action. For example, and this is simplifying it a lot, if the task is: Book a tutor session. You could observe how users *think* they're supposed to do it, and compare that with what the business says is the ""correct"" way to do the job. My recommendation would be to focus on something specific that you're hoping to improve through UXR/UXD"
660,2022-09-30T22:41:26.522000+00:00,I mean looking at the site it‚Äôs clear it‚Äôs not the best UX.
661,2022-09-30T22:40:01.677000+00:00,"Thank you! I will ask for those! The site also has a low conversion, so people are getting in the site, but not going through with the desired action. How would I approach that?"
662,2022-09-30T21:36:02.542000+00:00,"One way to go about this could be to see if there's any current website analytics that could help inform your direction! For example, you mentioned that the site isn't gaining much traffic. This could be a search engine optimization (SEO) issue, rather than a UX one. So even if you come up with a beautiful/usable website, it still won't address the main issue of ""not gaining much traffic"""
663,2022-09-30T21:02:03.610000+00:00,I want to know what frustrations people have felt using this site in order to improve the current product
664,2022-09-30T20:59:14.901000+00:00,It‚Äôs a website where people can book tutoring service
665,2022-09-30T20:38:18.595000+00:00,What kind of website is it?
666,2022-09-30T20:38:10.940000+00:00,Well I guess it first helps to define what you actually want to know in layman terms.
667,2022-09-30T20:33:33.624000+00:00,Hi everyone! I‚Äôm currently volunteering to get some experience. The project I‚Äôm currently working on is a website that is not gaining much traffic. I‚Äôm gonna conduct user interviews and I‚Äôm kinda stumped on what questions to ask. I‚Äôm not on researcher side of things so any tips would be helpful.
668,2022-09-30T16:07:59.846000+00:00,"To add onto Dario's point of it depends, I'd say some things to think about is **what **is being tested, and what **methodology **are you using. Let's say you're testing page A of a website, and then you test page B, but the two pages have no correlation, then possibly it wouldn't matter that your users were the same. But if you're testing for task-time (how long it takes users to complete tasks, then you probably don't want to use the same users since they'll already be familiar with the tasks / system, thus having an impact on the results"
669,2022-09-30T06:04:02.875000+00:00,And let‚Äôs say 5 or 6 users couldn‚Äôt possibly be representative. Thus you‚Äôre going to miss some issues and overprioritize others.
670,2022-09-30T06:03:37.854000+00:00,The problem is that you‚Äôre using the same sample again and again
671,2022-09-30T05:59:01.161000+00:00,"It depends which type of research.

But yeah, I imagine it turns quite into a snowballing effect. Wouldn‚Äôt call it sampling bias, but definitely has a similar effect."
672,2022-09-30T00:03:15.696000+00:00,"During UX Research, how prevalant is the bias/issue that if you use the same users throughout multiple tests of a product, that their perception of the product, intentionally or unintentionally, can negatively affect results?"
673,2022-09-30T00:02:27.009000+00:00,"A more out there question, but I will ask anyway"
674,2022-09-29T05:30:37.222000+00:00,"Yeah I guess it‚Äôs hard to just throw around a few measurements if there‚Äôs no clear research question of what needs to be measured .

What exactly do you define as the UX ‚Äòvision‚Äô here?"
675,2022-09-29T04:56:25.698000+00:00,"So we are tying to build on the UX vision for next year hence the study.. my main concern here is finding the right segments for measurement. 

Anyway thanks for your perspective <@209640428151111680> üòä"
676,2022-09-28T11:04:12.430000+00:00,So I'd suggest you also google it that way. You'll find much more relevant information.
677,2022-09-28T11:00:57.414000+00:00,"It's better to think in terms of comparative analysis instead of competitive. Especially in UX, people want to compare features (which could be the same in different markets). Not market competition."
678,2022-09-28T10:52:11.523000+00:00,"What is the goal of this research, what do you hope to learn?"
679,2022-09-28T10:50:46.521000+00:00,"I suppose it depends on what you want to learn. There could be a million different metrics. They entirely depend on your research question. If your question is ""How many companies have dogs in the office?"" then 'number of dogs' is the metric I suppose."
680,2022-09-28T10:49:47.931000+00:00,"SWOT is for comparing markets, so not necessarily for comparing products."
681,2022-09-28T10:39:48.624000+00:00,"For my upcoming study, I will be conducting a competitive analysis for the first time with our internal design and marketing team. The leadership has given us 5-6 use case and the screens for the same but I am not sure how to define the metrics for the same. I saw online about SWOT , user journey but are there any other examples that this can be done?"
682,2022-09-27T08:30:22.013000+00:00,https://uxinsight.org/ux-research-events/
683,2022-09-27T08:30:21.243000+00:00,Some UX research events coming up:
684,2022-09-26T20:16:23.550000+00:00,https://condens.io
685,2022-09-26T20:15:52.892000+00:00,Codens is quite popular at the moment
686,2022-09-26T17:54:58.867000+00:00,"question for user researchers -- where do you manage your user research insights? trying to find a good tool to use, I've used Dovetail in the past but didn't love it. right now am using a v unruly notion database!"
687,2022-09-25T21:18:42.507000+00:00,You can then build a pretty good argument for doing the decisions you do
688,2022-09-25T21:13:14.455000+00:00,"And how these difference influence the result; e.g. maybe company A is asking for too personal information, company B is asking to little information. Does the decrease in people willing to disclose information weight out the value of that information? Being able to call someone vs e-mail someone, for example."
689,2022-09-25T21:10:43.587000+00:00,Then the interesting part is how the five competitors forms are different from each other
690,2022-09-25T21:10:00.407000+00:00,"Which you can then very concretely answer: ""Business X is collecting information by using a form"" then support with some desk research ""A form is effective because XYZ."""
691,2022-09-25T21:07:56.822000+00:00,"Create sub questions for the main question; ""How do they collect personal information?"" or more specific ""Which information is being collected?"" and maybe more motivation ""How are they influencing the willingness of disclosing this information"" (though you need to have some desk research for this, for example persuasive principles used to increase disclosure like the reciprocity principle)"
692,2022-09-25T21:07:10.913000+00:00,Then maybe pick 5 competitors that are top of the game.
693,2022-09-25T21:06:50.913000+00:00,"You can basically build an entire competitive analysis under that one goal. As the main research question ""What are effective ways competitors are using to request demo's?"" Or rather ""Which ways are competitors getting clients to request demo's?"" because it being effective is a step too far."
694,2022-09-25T21:01:30.894000+00:00,üëçüèªüëçüèª thank you for your input!
695,2022-09-25T21:00:36.165000+00:00,"Not really 'what are their weaknesses?' but, what are effective ways competitors are using to request demo's? What are the common 'known to work' patterns in that specific design"
696,2022-09-25T20:58:42.668000+00:00,See what's worth stealing üëÄ
697,2022-09-25T20:58:08.750000+00:00,"Then maybe running competitive audits like Darren says. Not really heuristic evaluations, but really looking at analysing competitors design. Not to compare their website against it, but to really analyse what kind of things they're doing and supporting desk-research what kind of effects those things have, if that makes sense."
698,2022-09-25T20:53:53.778000+00:00,"No, they aren‚Äôt currently collecting email addresses. They‚Äôre a very early stage startup so it seems they just threw their website together out of necessity and have mostly been doing business offline üòÖ"
699,2022-09-25T20:45:28.520000+00:00,Ahh so there isn‚Äôt some mailing funnel in place either? At least previously? Or any sort of data
700,2022-09-25T20:40:31.981000+00:00,"That's what I'm trying to figure out. I think there might be 2-3 target users such as cafe owners, cafe chefs and cafe manager etc. Are there some other people I would need to interview?"
701,2022-09-25T20:39:12.116000+00:00,Who would be the target user for the recipe planner app? Would it be the cafe owners?
702,2022-09-25T20:37:40.328000+00:00,"That's a great point on A/B testing. However, their current website doesn't even have a CTA. Right now, they just have an email address listed and users are manually emailing their sales team for info or their sales team is doing outreach outside of the website. So, one of my recommendations for the redesign is to implement a form for users to fill their information to request a demo from sales, which we would then measure conversions from. In this case, how would I fairly measure the original design against the new design?"
703,2022-09-25T19:53:24.935000+00:00,So that depends how you plan to use the results and how good your statistical skills are.
704,2022-09-25T19:51:48.284000+00:00,"I suppose so. But more as a benchmark. It's not a tool to discover usability issues, just a tool to benchmark it across different re-designs, or before and after usability testing."
705,2022-09-25T17:47:24.234000+00:00,"Hello guys! I'm new to UX and doing course on it. The portfolio prompt that I chose was ""Design a recipe planner app for a cafe in your favorite city"". Now I want to recruit users for user research but I want some input on what kind of users will I have to interview? Can someone help me out on this?"
706,2022-09-25T17:18:56.762000+00:00,"Ah so maybe time on task and conversion rates?
Generally speaking, would SUS still be fine in terms of trying to figure out how easy it is for users to navigate and use the app and its layout"
707,2022-09-25T12:36:45.614000+00:00,"Hi, I everyone I'm doing a research for that I'll need some feedback with similar apps' users. If you buy a ticket for theater through your smartphone please reach me out here https://calendly.com/atakanbacaksiz/30min"
708,2022-09-25T12:12:53.996000+00:00,"If you can spot obvious design issues I don't think you need to spend resources to perform usability tests. Just point them out, cite Norman or some other credible source to give your points more power"
709,2022-09-25T12:11:57.066000+00:00,"I had a similar scenario once. I performed a thorough design review of the current design and made sure to cite highly regarded sources on topics that would surely cause debate. If what I am reading is true, the focus here is not for now to propose a specific redesign, but to clarify that a redesign is needed."
710,2022-09-25T06:34:27.556000+00:00,"Well depends. If your goal is 'Can users make quick informed decisions?"" will SUS and conversion really measure that?"
711,2022-09-25T06:29:18.688000+00:00,"If it's really too justify the new design, you need to benchmark the previous design to the current design. So that will be A/B testing. Usually through quant usability testing or just through the site analytics. You need to define the metric of success (for example conversion rate) and then see how much better it does. 

Heuristic evaluations are great tools to find re-design opportunities for a website. But in no way it's a justification or proof that it's actually better than the previous design. It still needs to be followed up by a quant A/B test using T testing."
712,2022-09-24T20:42:08.586000+00:00,imo I feel like testing on target audience that may not necessarily use their software is adequate as those that are going to use their software are already aware of what the company and product do. Could you do a competitive audit and then a heuristic evaluation on the marketing website AND competitor website and see how users feel using one or the other?
713,2022-09-24T20:35:28.437000+00:00,"Hey yall, I'm currently trying to decide on a KPI for this project that i'm working on for the certification program. My project background is trying to make a website or app that allows users to quickly view and decide on where to eat based on craving using AI-powered assessments. The app will be more social media oriented where people post food and reviews of food rather than reviews being skewed by other extraneous factors such as ambiance and service, etc. 
**TLDR**; trying to figure out if food assessment to produce restaurants based on cravings can help users quickly make informed decisions.

I was thinking of using System usability scale (SUS) and conversion rates as my KPI - what do yall think? should i add one more KPI? should I replace one?
Thanks in advance"
714,2022-09-24T19:51:25.535000+00:00,"Hi everyone! I have a question about research methods. My client is a software-as-a-service (SaaS) startup and I'm working with them to redesign their marketing website. Their website is obviously visually inconsistent, but I would like to understand: What are the best research methods to justify the redesign? Should I start with a heuristic evaluation?

Should I conduct a usability test on the existing website, and how should I go about that? Their target audience is enterprise businesses in education or training. Since I'm testing their marketing website, not their actual product, would it be sufficient to conduct the usability test with users that are in their target industry, but may not necessarily *use* their software? Because I would need to test that their marketing website properly conveys what their company and product does, right?"
715,2022-09-23T16:43:02.508000+00:00,‚ÄúWould this product influence your productivity in any way?‚Äù Or something alike..:
716,2022-09-23T16:41:38.991000+00:00,Possibly! Though I‚Äôm going to do them in a qualitative interview. So maybe just framing them neutrally
717,2022-09-23T14:34:13.889000+00:00,"One approach could be to do something similar as SUS questions, where half are more positively framed while the other half is negative?"
718,2022-09-23T11:20:22.662000+00:00,"To those who texted with me regarding a first interview, I passed the first step ü•≥! Thanks for all the help!
Next up is a 'Technical interview"" with a 1h speculative scenario session... Anyone with experience from UX Research technical interviews?"
719,2022-09-23T09:31:45.490000+00:00,"Though, it's a little bit positively framed... <:ThinkEyes:711813052433039370>"
720,2022-09-23T09:30:42.504000+00:00,"It asks:

722,2022-09-23T09:29:57.199000+00:00,Mhh any researchers have experience with the TAM (Technology Acceptance Model)?
723,2022-09-23T05:17:19.123000+00:00,"I‚Äôm actual in school right now as a grad student in Human Factors. Since this fall semester is my first so I lack technical skills as well as research experience. biggest block for me is I‚Äôm stuck in dead end design job (product design on title but it‚Äôs actually a glorified UI factory churning role) that doesn‚Äôt contribute in anything meaningful toward the career I want to pursue except for paying bills. I‚Äôve tried advocate for research as well as better UX maturity for years in my organization but nothing improved. That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm turning to research internships as I don‚Äôt know any other outlet to learn from other mentors. Thought I ask here to see how designer transition to research, what‚Äôs the journey like for them. Thank you for your suggestions, appreciate your input üôè"
724,2022-09-22T20:49:34.663000+00:00,"My recommendation for you right now would be to somehow find an opportunity to get real research practice. 

Taking on extra projects outside of your work responsibilities so you can practice research is a step you can take, as is finding a mentor to walk you through simple research projects, or networking with researchers in the industry to shadow them."
725,2022-09-22T20:46:18.699000+00:00,"The reality is that if you have been out of school for a few years, there are very few to no internships available because you are a career transitioner. You are not a fresher or in school so you cannot qualify for internships in *almost* all instances. 

Previous design experience doesn't necessarily impact research hiring decisions but it can be viewed positively to some orgs/hiring managers because you are familiar with product thinking, design, agile, and professionalism in general. 

Ultimately, your research skills still have to be on par for what the hiring manager is looking for."
726,2022-09-22T20:33:50.449000+00:00,"I'm a researcher working on my master's. It's a switch ngl. In corporate research it's usually presenting your findings in a readable way or at the very least ""give me the top line"", academic research is ""cite everything and we'll peer review it to boot."" It's a bit mind boggling. üòµ"
727,2022-09-22T05:45:50.029000+00:00,"I guess the biggest benefit is that you‚Äôre already in the industry. Thus it‚Äôs easier to network with UXRs.

So it may be more beneficial to first work at a company that has UX researchers, rather than some internship."
728,2022-09-22T00:49:58.028000+00:00,That‚Äôs awesome. I‚Äôm currently a product designer looking to transition into UXR. I unfortunately haven‚Äôt done much research at all in my career due to low UX maturity in my organization. Does previous design experience give them any big advantages when it come to job search? I want to look for UXR internship but unsure if I‚Äôll be considered when I‚Äôm not trained in research at all.
729,2022-09-22T00:34:34.993000+00:00,At work I know a handful off the top of my head who transitioned as well! It is definitely a route you can take
730,2022-09-22T00:33:45.188000+00:00,A number of designers become researchers. A close friend of mine started out as a creative director and is now a researcher.
731,2022-09-22T00:19:06.976000+00:00,"Hello fellow researchers, I wonder is there any of you make a career switch from design to research?"
732,2022-09-21T14:33:19.378000+00:00,Yes
733,2022-09-21T14:12:17.875000+00:00,Bachelor?
734,2022-09-21T14:12:04.739000+00:00,Yeah I did
735,2022-09-21T14:11:46.050000+00:00,Now I get it
736,2022-09-21T09:40:52.179000+00:00,Soon enough you need a PhD in neuropsychology

746,2022-09-21T08:56:01.794000+00:00,She means that even if you 'pick' a carreer that you don't like eventually you can always switch

Learning what you don't want to do is the best thing to figuring out wat you want to do"
753,2022-09-21T01:53:43.812000+00:00,Make the best decision you can at this point in time with what you know.
754,2022-09-21T01:53:32.225000+00:00,sort of
755,2022-09-21T01:48:52.726000+00:00,"I am just struggling really hard to pick out a career, I wish I had a coach"
756,2022-09-21T01:46:34.529000+00:00,yeah you are correct here
757,2022-09-21T01:45:05.440000+00:00,UX Research through youtube and medium articles are not reflective of what you will experience day-to-day as a researcher.
758,2022-09-21T01:42:25.416000+00:00,"Whether you go for a graduate degree is something you will have to answer. But if you do end up going for a masters or a phd, make sure you've shadowed a couple ux researchers so you know this is what you want. 

I have known a few researchers who landed their first role and left the entire tech industry saying this was not what they want."
759,2022-09-21T01:35:10.631000+00:00,Honestly I don't think I can compete with master degree holders nor do I possess the talent to compensate for my lack of masters
760,2022-09-21T01:34:41.134000+00:00,"I'm a researcher with only a bachelors btw and I know researchers who don't have more than a bachelors but we are a small minority. There are many more researchers who have, at minimum, a masters."
761,2022-09-21T01:28:00.580000+00:00,"You don't *need* a masters or phd but there is a much higher chance of landing a research role if you do. 
You will want to ask yourself whether you're willing and capable of competing with other candidates who have a masters or phd where you don't have one yourself and still come out top."
762,2022-09-21T00:42:08.998000+00:00,Thank you!
763,2022-09-21T00:13:06.745000+00:00,I'll ping <@733042329140723792> for a professional 2nd opinion tho
764,2022-09-21T00:10:34.993000+00:00,Thank you for being honest I appreciate it
765,2022-09-21T00:03:04.295000+00:00,it is a science after all
766,2022-09-21T00:02:51.540000+00:00,"in order to do proper ux research, grad school is pretty important"
767,2022-09-20T22:13:07.653000+00:00,does ux research need grad school?
768,2022-09-20T20:57:55.262000+00:00,Maybe you can use the 2k for travel + tickets supplemented with some personal cost
769,2022-09-20T20:57:31.007000+00:00,Oh definitely buy the inperson uxr conference tickets
770,2022-09-20T20:57:02.181000+00:00,I'm trying to think of any that I really enjoyed
771,2022-09-20T20:50:56.703000+00:00,Was also looking at the nngroup courses
772,2022-09-20T20:50:25.624000+00:00,Yeah definitely trying to spend it. Already done some writing course (for reports) and will also have some basic stats for quant
773,2022-09-20T20:42:28.799000+00:00,I've never left money on the table in regards to my educational stipend
774,2022-09-20T20:41:37.769000+00:00,yeah! use every single cent
775,2022-09-20T20:41:29.644000+00:00,Doing it and saying it isn't worth it is different from hearing someone say it isn't worth it and parroting what articles and other people say
776,2022-09-20T20:41:21.325000+00:00,Educational budget
777,2022-09-20T20:41:08.264000+00:00,I got 2K a year I suppose
778,2022-09-20T20:40:49.667000+00:00,"I did a lot of things where I have budget for my own professional growth. If you have the opportunity, do it. Worth it each time."
779,2022-09-20T20:39:18.346000+00:00,Still haven‚Äôt used the eye tracker in a year either though üëÄ

781,2022-09-20T20:13:30.466000+00:00,So I guess it‚Äôs more a tool that could be an addition to a qual study like an intro of 5 mins
782,2022-09-20T20:12:45.594000+00:00,"Easily flawed by anything that happens around it. E.g. a messy room will already mess up the findings. Or just interacting with the user, like asking a question while they‚Äôre attached."
783,2022-09-20T20:12:25.535000+00:00,And it works like eye tracking

785,2022-09-20T20:12:01.212000+00:00,They only really measure three things

787,2022-09-20T20:11:43.141000+00:00,
788,2022-09-20T20:11:26.866000+00:00,It is great some teams have this type of resourcing and budget but these gadgets aren't necessary.
789,2022-09-20T20:10:16.261000+00:00,üëÄ i'm not really sure the outcomes warrant the cost

797,2022-09-20T16:31:02.210000+00:00,Today I talked to some researchers using neuro research
798,2022-09-20T00:15:02.259000+00:00,"Great point, thank you"
799,2022-09-20T00:10:52.441000+00:00,I would ask yourself whether a screenshot of a word document is how you want to present yourself.
800,2022-09-20T00:10:01.146000+00:00,"Knowing that a researcher could have.. 
- easily copy and pasted the content instead, 
- formatted that content to be visually structured,
- included/created visuals,

the way you show effort can be endless"
801,2022-09-20T00:05:08.440000+00:00,"How would you perceive being shown a screenshot of a word doc in presentation? <:FrogHmm:879768611240149052> Would you think that the researcher giving out the presentation put in 100% effort, 75% effort, 50%?"
802,2022-09-19T23:24:52.879000+00:00,"Any UXRs around, I just have a quick question about UXR portfolios. I'm creating a web-based portfolio, and I'm currently unsure how to display artifacts. For example, do I just take a screenshot of a study plan and place the image within the page so they see I did create one? Do I embed the google doc of the study plan to keep it readable?"
803,2022-09-19T20:18:44.261000+00:00,"But that's a good setup I think, thanks :)!"

806,2022-09-19T20:17:04.205000+00:00,just use the case study that is the closest to
807,2022-09-19T20:16:59.250000+00:00,Bleh üòÖ UX y u so complex
808,2022-09-19T20:16:49.761000+00:00,"regardless, if you don't have a research project to show"
809,2022-09-19T20:12:08.535000+00:00,"and a lot of people have ""bought-in"" to the idea that it's a real, totally scalable thing"
810,2022-09-19T20:11:46.413000+00:00,but its easy and succinct to teach it that way
811,2022-09-19T20:11:24.664000+00:00,there is no such thing as a discovery phase
812,2022-09-19T20:11:17.676000+00:00,full process is a lie
813,2022-09-19T20:10:55.104000+00:00,"I just feel that in the industry, you rarely get to perform a full process from start to finish in the same way you got to do when studying. This seems to be the consensus among many people I hear from in the industry, especially among UX Designers"
814,2022-09-19T20:07:03.476000+00:00,"Right, welp I certainly think I am slightly underqualified for this role but hey I wanted to try anways. Wont be too sad if I don't get the position but one has to try. I work solo in UX for a small startup where I get to do a lot of both research and design but the company size makes it hard to really have a far too rigid process which I think could be good here. But hey, they called me in for an interview soo :P.... I will play mostly on the 'I'm still junior and could develop into something;);)'-card... or something lol

I actually have a much better project, more ""school booky"" example in my repertoire that I have prepared, but it is from my final year at uni. To be honest, my startup processes have usually been a bit more ""quick and dirty"" and I know it. Do you think I should go for that project instead? I have already prepared that one"
815,2022-09-19T20:05:20.203000+00:00,Here is how I visualized the data so that the team could digest it
816,2022-09-19T20:04:29.327000+00:00,"this is the p value, and this is why it's OK if it wasnt statistically significant"
817,2022-09-19T20:02:34.946000+00:00,"this is my protocol, this is my test script"
818,2022-09-19T20:02:30.404000+00:00,this is what we wanted to learn
819,2022-09-19T20:02:21.022000+00:00,but a research interview should be like

822,2022-09-19T20:01:35.616000+00:00,"if this is a researcher role, I dont really care about the context as much as your ability to make good decisions, and have good process and hygiene"
823,2022-09-19T19:48:42.131000+00:00,"Soo... what do you think they want to see? A sort of mini-research poster maybe?

Right... guess that's how I should think about it. I think I have kind of an idea of how to proceed with this. I will be giving some details (but not all) but invite them to ask any questions should they have any. My feeling is simply that the'd want to use the presentation as discussion material, rather than having a full presentation"
824,2022-09-19T19:41:57.839000+00:00,"being able to explain complicated concepts is not dumbing things down, it is developing your communication skills."
825,2022-09-19T19:41:18.537000+00:00,"also, you should not be 'dumbing things down'"
826,2022-09-19T19:41:07.803000+00:00,but make sure you have a case study prepared in case
827,2022-09-19T19:40:53.251000+00:00,oh i see then they're looking to chat with you without a case study if they said to limit the presentation to 5minutes
828,2022-09-19T19:39:23.662000+00:00,"I have met one of the persons before though, she was an examiner for a project I did at uni a few years ago"
829,2022-09-19T19:38:04.428000+00:00,First contact. I received a mail that my application passed the first CV screening and now it's video interview
830,2022-09-19T19:33:52.849000+00:00,Maybe this is a behavioral interview? Is this your first interview with the company outside of a phone screen?
831,2022-09-19T19:21:07.117000+00:00,"Rather than trying to go into the details which one might actually want to hear. But I mean, 5 minutes sounds more like they just want a brief anyways"
832,2022-09-19T19:20:34.251000+00:00,"I'm currently thinking of just dumbing everything down, an telling them I'm doing it for the sake of being able to present these things in 5 minutes"

843,2022-09-16T19:46:45.489000+00:00,I've done that
844,2022-09-16T19:46:13.295000+00:00,Ok dyno
845,2022-09-16T19:44:26.942000+00:00,"Hello <@987899167831633950>, please move your post to <#708809627260944436>. Thank you."
846,2022-09-16T18:50:55.604000+00:00,"Yeah <@209640428151111680>, I just lurked through your guys‚Äô conversation. Was very helpful! <:0_db_FluffleLurk:879252375242670101>  üòÖ"
847,2022-09-16T18:44:51.545000+00:00,Well thank you‚ù§Ô∏è
848,2022-09-16T18:19:23.208000+00:00,but that‚Äôs just my opinion
849,2022-09-16T18:19:13.641000+00:00,I‚Äôd say it is up to the listener to take what they need from it
850,2022-09-16T18:18:57.037000+00:00,I think you speak from your experience! Which is a good thing ‚ò∫Ô∏è
851,2022-09-16T18:07:21.829000+00:00,I only research though! So it may be a bit of a different context sometimes
852,2022-09-16T18:05:58.660000+00:00,seeing how other designers approach things is always interesting
853,2022-09-16T18:05:33.774000+00:00,seems pretty on point though
854,2022-09-16T18:02:44.387000+00:00,haha true
855,2022-09-16T17:58:15.260000+00:00,Yeah you‚Äôd never know whether I‚Äôm just talking out of my ass though
856,2022-09-16T17:55:49.395000+00:00,Speaking with you <@209640428151111680> is always a joy. I always learn something new üôÇ
857,2022-09-16T17:55:14.175000+00:00,interesting
858,2022-09-16T17:48:08.935000+00:00,For political reasons
859,2022-09-16T17:48:02.936000+00:00,We also invite them to watch the user test live
860,2022-09-16T17:46:58.532000+00:00,You talk impact not design.
861,2022-09-16T17:45:58.984000+00:00,The business impact is always the focus.
862,2022-09-16T17:45:26.011000+00:00,Design or research is merely the instrument
863,2022-09-16T17:45:09.112000+00:00,Doesn‚Äôt really matter. They have goals / questions / decisions they need to make.
864,2022-09-16T17:44:06.534000+00:00,Yeah usually. Some stakeholders hear the word UX research for the first time.
865,2022-09-16T17:43:29.978000+00:00,"Like people who are a big part of the business, but have no experience working with designers basically. Is what I'm thinking of when I'm thinking about personality types!"
866,2022-09-16T17:42:28.442000+00:00,"My worry would be inviting folks in for a session (who have no background on the project), they get there, then they have nothing to say. Or they are like -- but aren't you the designer?  Shouldn't you do it? Or shouldn't you know? Which of course, I don't. That's why I'd be inviting them üòÇ"
867,2022-09-16T17:40:48.524000+00:00,Yeah that could happen. def a benefit from doing individual interviews. But have you worked with folks who have no experience with designers or thoughts on product?
868,2022-09-16T17:36:55.471000+00:00,Which you only know if they‚Äôre not together
869,2022-09-16T17:36:44.140000+00:00,Two separate stakeholders could have different agendas entirely
870,2022-09-16T17:36:29.022000+00:00,Yeah only downsides of groups is that they feed each other‚Äôs opinions
871,2022-09-16T17:36:02.934000+00:00,"which may be less of a concern for some teams, depending."
872,2022-09-16T17:35:46.214000+00:00,And perhaps how familiar the stakeholders are with the design proccess
873,2022-09-16T17:35:17.036000+00:00,"No I love this approach! I'd say it probably depends on the objectives, what is required, and the personalities involved."
874,2022-09-16T17:31:12.093000+00:00,Though if you got the hours
875,2022-09-16T17:30:43.404000+00:00,Just less time efficient
876,2022-09-16T17:30:38.663000+00:00,Stakeholder interviews are nice too
877,2022-09-16T17:28:00.699000+00:00,Which partly defines the research scenarios
878,2022-09-16T17:27:45.917000+00:00,Generally our strategy got like a costumer journey session too
879,2022-09-16T17:27:26.533000+00:00,With including design may be different too
880,2022-09-16T17:25:04.003000+00:00,oh okay gotcha
881,2022-09-16T17:23:51.599000+00:00,You participate but must also time manage and lead the session
882,2022-09-16T17:22:55.794000+00:00,Start 10 minutes timer
883,2022-09-16T17:22:46.472000+00:00,"It‚Äôs a white board session, so you got something like: ‚Äúwhat would you like to know‚Äù"
884,2022-09-16T17:21:42.557000+00:00,Also brainstorm timers of like 10 mins for one session
885,2022-09-16T17:21:22.195000+00:00,Depends how many section you have structured
886,2022-09-16T17:21:08.955000+00:00,Often these sessions take 1 to 1.5 hour for me
887,2022-09-16T17:20:54.526000+00:00,Mhh 30 mins is quite short
888,2022-09-16T17:20:30.827000+00:00,"Sorry just trying to understand, haha."
889,2022-09-16T17:19:27.915000+00:00,Just to clarify -- everyone give feedback on the same questions in real time? over the course of 30 minutes or so?
890,2022-09-16T17:18:12.141000+00:00,"Maybe something like this could be implemented along the design proccess, as a check in later down the line"
891,2022-09-16T17:15:56.100000+00:00,or question the importance of marketing
892,2022-09-16T17:15:48.213000+00:00,Some even question the reason for website improvements at all
893,2022-09-16T17:15:27.150000+00:00,The challenge with the team I work with is that tech is foreign to them
894,2022-09-16T17:15:04.617000+00:00,"Ah I see. I guess that could be useful if the team is up on tech, and knows what they want out of the product."
895,2022-09-16T17:11:57.379000+00:00,Repeat
896,2022-09-16T17:11:54.890000+00:00,Write report
897,2022-09-16T17:11:46.493000+00:00,Moderate research
898,2022-09-16T17:11:41.799000+00:00,Write test script
899,2022-09-16T17:11:36.901000+00:00,At least me
900,2022-09-16T17:11:32.182000+00:00,It‚Äôs basically all you do as a UXR
901,2022-09-16T17:11:12.793000+00:00,that form the base of your test
902,2022-09-16T17:11:00.236000+00:00,test script = instruction set for your test. typically it has line by line prompts / questions
903,2022-09-16T17:10:48.709000+00:00,Scoped on the minute
904,2022-09-16T17:10:38.016000+00:00,It‚Äôs like an interview guide
905,2022-09-16T17:09:35.946000+00:00,I'm not familair with a test script... is that like a usability script?
906,2022-09-16T17:09:03.213000+00:00,like across a cross-functional team?
907,2022-09-16T17:08:57.009000+00:00,so i think a way to get aligned on research goals?
908,2022-09-16T17:08:27.360000+00:00,I am so fascinated by this
909,2022-09-16T17:06:19.414000+00:00,Not the design
910,2022-09-16T17:06:11.510000+00:00,This is just the research though
911,2022-09-16T17:06:03.300000+00:00,The benefit of this is that everyone that is in the project is together for 1/2 hours to align all expectations to be one the same page
912,2022-09-16T17:04:38.132000+00:00,Which then can be used as input for the actual research
913,2022-09-16T17:04:08.508000+00:00,It's more like a easy whiteboard session for the client to put down in words/postits what they want to know
914,2022-09-16T17:03:41.642000+00:00,So it's not really a stakeholder interview in that sense
915,2022-09-16T17:03:09.834000+00:00,And put back and forth with the client so we know exactly what needs to be known
916,2022-09-16T17:02:34.862000+00:00,This will be turned into a test script. Which is a sort of research strategy document
917,2022-09-16T17:02:08.670000+00:00,"What do you want to know before the test, what after the test, etc ect"
918,2022-09-16T17:01:57.167000+00:00,"So one section might be ""What are you goals?"""
919,2022-09-16T17:01:17.088000+00:00,"All the screens will be set into a miro, so people can paste post its on specific locations in the app/web"
920,2022-09-16T17:00:56.093000+00:00,
921,2022-09-16T17:00:30.427000+00:00,Then if it's a usability test
922,2022-09-16T17:00:17.923000+00:00,"Basically we invite the clients, designers, whomever may be concerned into a session to define waht they want to know"
923,2022-09-16T16:55:15.184000+00:00,oh cool thanks haha!
924,2022-09-16T16:54:52.358000+00:00,Mhh let me show you an example
925,2022-09-16T16:54:36.582000+00:00,What's a script session?
926,2022-09-16T16:54:24.294000+00:00,Which is basically another way to align goals
927,2022-09-16T16:54:14.011000+00:00,We do script sessions
928,2022-09-16T16:53:43.682000+00:00,yeah
929,2022-09-16T16:52:06.285000+00:00,"But yeah, definitely a good starting point to understand the goal of the product and different incentives/ visions of different stakeholders"
930,2022-09-16T16:51:22.058000+00:00,Simply because I don‚Äôt get the hours for it
931,2022-09-16T16:51:11.262000+00:00,"I guess even for me personally it‚Äôs often more so done by the strategy / design lead at the start of the project, probably also during the sales of the actual project"
932,2022-09-16T16:50:49.260000+00:00,Ohh in that sense stakeholder interviews
933,2022-09-16T16:50:02.230000+00:00,"It would probably depend on the goal of the research, right?  Sometimes there are no personas, or no ux research done prior. If we're starting from ground zero, in some sense we need to know more about the business goals, and who we're designing for. Which I think has been the biggest struggle for me, as a design team of one!"
934,2022-09-16T16:48:07.199000+00:00,during feature definition
935,2022-09-16T16:48:03.013000+00:00,vs. having to play telephone
936,2022-09-16T16:47:59.510000+00:00,However I think that UX Designers should be equipped and trained more broadly to do this themselves
937,2022-09-16T16:47:04.385000+00:00,wanting to conduct them
938,2022-09-16T16:47:00.137000+00:00,in the absence of someone who is more research focused
939,2022-09-16T16:46:52.393000+00:00,commonly conducted by UXR's
940,2022-09-16T16:46:46.899000+00:00,I think the stakeholder interview activity is probably
941,2022-09-16T16:46:35.479000+00:00,and I take it all back
942,2022-09-16T16:46:33.410000+00:00,as I was making a bagel
943,2022-09-16T16:46:30.560000+00:00,so I was thinking about what I said
944,2022-09-16T16:40:37.235000+00:00,You're probably actually fine here.
945,2022-09-16T16:40:33.391000+00:00,and then I misread his intention with my post.
946,2022-09-16T16:40:24.363000+00:00,I also think Dario misread your first post
947,2022-09-16T16:40:09.140000+00:00,and not specifically UX / User Research
948,2022-09-16T16:40:04.080000+00:00,Maybe this channel should just be Research
949,2022-09-16T16:39:02.674000+00:00,"kind of like UX Designers, most UXR's are primarily trained to evaluate usability things"
950,2022-09-16T16:35:00.941000+00:00,"<@209640428151111680> + <@218928410263683073>  can you clarify what you mean? Sorry if I misstepped here, but I consider stakeholder interviews as the first step in the UXR proccess."
951,2022-09-16T16:33:51.641000+00:00,Thanks for this!! This is really helping me right now... as I'm tasked with drafting 6 stakeholder interview guides... the process continues...!

955,2022-09-14T18:51:05.942000+00:00,You will uncover a wealth of interesting anecdotes and learnings through the comments and feedback you'll get as you try stuff
956,2022-09-14T18:50:08.971000+00:00,"These kinds of situations are opportunities for designers to probe, poke, and prod."
957,2022-09-14T18:46:28.887000+00:00,"You can lean on the expertise your colleagues have as a starting point regardless. Your role is to take the bits and bobs you think are most valuable in forming some kind of tangible thing to guide conversations to move forward. It may not be totally up to you ‚Äî and rarely are the designers the main decision makers in these scenarios anyway. Take your best stab at something, whatever that something is that can help rally folks together. Shop it around separately, talk about the things each of their specific roles care about, incorporate the things you believe are valuable, discard the rest."
958,2022-09-14T18:38:49.456000+00:00,"It‚Äôs not totally up to me. But given that we have no user research at this point, I think it will help us design smarter. The process is kind of slowed down because everyone wants to be involved."
959,2022-09-14T18:36:37.713000+00:00,it is more like 1/2  that bc we work pt hours.
960,2022-09-14T17:25:19.609000+00:00,We have weekly feedback moments during the process
961,2022-09-14T16:55:18.368000+00:00,You help move conversations forward
962,2022-09-14T16:55:00.644000+00:00,"Frank answer: You act on your best guess and iterate from there. As a designer, the single most influential thing you can do is turn the abstract into something more tangible based on your training."
963,2022-09-14T16:53:48.082000+00:00,let alone a more lengthy period of time
964,2022-09-14T16:53:39.239000+00:00,"What are you doing in the meantime? Even 1-2 weeks feels like a really long time to be doing nothing but ""discovery"""
965,2022-09-14T15:57:43.959000+00:00,"I do freelance ux/web design and yesterday my manager there received some pushback over doing stakeholder interviews for a site update from a client. The founder wanted to write the interviews, and be part of the process. What we anticipated as 1 - 2 week process total, is turning out to be much longer, with additional user interviews built in (which I think was a good thing.. we needed that). We don't anticipate the discovery process to be completed and initial wireframes to begin by early October. The team is a mixture of perfectionists, and people who want mockups now. 

I had another client recently that followed the much more conventional design sprint-- all hands on deck. This client does things at a slower pace. And of course bootcamp teaches you the ideal 2-week and 3-week sprint, but not how things seem to go in the real world. It's interesting to see how different organizations manage design. 

But how do I manage expectations? How do you? 

it can be difficult to guess, when there are so many variables to consider!"
966,2022-09-13T17:54:22.953000+00:00,SPSS works fine for most stats you ever need for ux
967,2022-09-13T17:53:31.611000+00:00,Just a perk üèÖ
968,2022-09-13T17:53:18.486000+00:00,"But yeah, it‚Äôs definitely not a requirement!"
969,2022-09-13T17:52:41.106000+00:00,‚Ä¶oh
970,2022-09-13T17:52:26.327000+00:00,It‚Äôs a programming language specifically for statistics
971,2022-09-13T17:52:01.209000+00:00,"I‚Äôm not familiar with R, it‚Äôs basically open source SPSS?"
972,2022-09-13T17:48:34.146000+00:00,The research agency I work at is trying to make a complete switch to R for example
973,2022-09-13T17:47:05.233000+00:00,Compared to the free open source R and Python
974,2022-09-13T17:46:55.470000+00:00,Yeah it‚Äôs just that SPSS is very expensive
975,2022-09-13T17:40:20.514000+00:00,"Oh thank god, I‚Äôm at least familiar with this one from psych research"
976,2022-09-13T17:20:55.480000+00:00,Even among quant it‚Äôs often just SPSS
977,2022-09-13T17:20:30.435000+00:00,But definitely not a common skill
978,2022-09-13T17:20:23.276000+00:00,"It‚Äôs just useful for quant research, when you need stats"
979,2022-09-13T17:11:29.654000+00:00,"Yes, that works too. Preferably in the commercial space. Do you know someone?"
980,2022-09-13T16:37:05.900000+00:00,"Not necessarily! You can specialize in qualitative research where python, r, matlab etc isn't necessary."

985,2022-09-13T06:51:50.490000+00:00,However strange enough Python seemed really weird for me. The way you code etc.
986,2022-09-13T06:51:17.392000+00:00,Mhh R is more specific for purely statistics. Python more all-round I suppose. And I will only ever use it for purely statistics for data analysis.
987,2022-09-13T05:03:44.924000+00:00,Last time I really did Python for analyzing was simulated annealing

1001,2022-09-08T17:41:18.589000+00:00,"a struggle we have is we don't do observational studies as much as we'd like, so when we run large tests, I have to figure out how to capture data and then cross reference it with the quant from the survey."

1009,2022-09-08T17:36:20.070000+00:00,"yeah tbh it was my fault. since game system specs get pretty complicated (select manufacturer, then gen, then model, then your ram, do the same with graphics) and our users were mentioning that the survey ""looked long"" despite the skip logic and/or their specs weren't listed (super potato pc outlier), so I was like, ""oh okay, we'll just free text that! :V""

1040,2022-09-06T01:28:50.050000+00:00,"You can start by learning more about UX, UI or Product Design, having a more open view of Design and its areas, creating a portfolio and looking for a job to gain experience. And then, as you grow as a Designer, you will narrow it down and focus on Research."

1054,2022-09-02T08:15:59.999000+00:00,That‚Äôs this book
1055,2022-09-02T08:13:42.299000+00:00,The book ‚ÄúThe mom test‚Äù provides some alternatives for this very question too
1056,2022-09-02T08:12:59.769000+00:00,"Maybe not entirely foolproof, because this implies rational choice theory. Which isn‚Äôt always true."
1057,2022-09-02T08:11:26.356000+00:00,Thus basically what is the cost of the current behaviour
1058,2022-09-02T08:08:54.966000+00:00,For example one could research the willingness to pay of Netflix by finding out how much money people are currently spending on a video store. (20 years ago at least)
1059,2022-09-02T08:05:23.008000+00:00,"For example, is the problem costing them any money right now?"
1060,2022-09-02T08:04:26.080000+00:00,A better alternative is to understand the implications of the problem
1061,2022-09-02T03:11:05.952000+00:00,"I totally agree with that, which I think is causing the roadblock on my end. Do you have suggestions or examples of the alternative series of questions (or a resource that might point me to the right direction)? Appreciate the insight by the way!"
1062,2022-09-02T03:07:42.774000+00:00,<:FrogThink:800949698880864327> there is probably an alternative series of questions that you can ask to reach the same goal of the question you're asking.
1063,2022-09-02T03:04:42.424000+00:00,Hypotheticals are typically unreliable and it moves even further away when it is based on behavior that the user has never experienced.
1064,2022-09-02T03:02:47.534000+00:00,"Whether it is a direct inquiry on price or an inquiry of whether a feature makes it more enticing for a user to become a customer, the issue with the study you're trying to conduct is that it is based on a ""would you..."" question."
1065,2022-09-02T00:54:43.080000+00:00,"Is this the same if I‚Äôm more concerned about the sentiment rather than the amount? I know there‚Äôs things like Van Westendorp and conjoint analysis, but that‚Äôs more for pricing (which would be left to our marketing/growth team). 

Basically, I‚Äôm being asked to gauge sentiment in a section of my survey for whether implementing a beta feature would entice a user to either switch to a paid subscription, or pay more for their current subscription. I‚Äôm just not sure how to ask without being direct about it."
1066,2022-09-01T23:36:14.294000+00:00,pricing is determined in various ways but those methods do not include qualitative or quantitative feedback from users
1067,2022-09-01T23:19:19.910000+00:00,"Not sure if this is the right place ot ask but what is the best way to gauge willingness to pay in a UX survey (e.g., I want to see if people are willing to pay more/upgrade current subscription if we were to charge for a new feature/change current pricing)?"
1068,2022-09-01T19:08:47.584000+00:00,Are you running into recruitment problems? Unable to structure a test plan? Don't know how to start a discussion guide?
1069,2022-09-01T19:06:57.248000+00:00,This is a great question that is like a loaded potato! It would help if you narrowed down your question to one step of the research process you'd like help on.
1070,2022-09-01T18:11:02.330000+00:00,"I believe this, even though I've never experienced this. What ways can we emulate the real world situation while we are doing self-initiated projects?

1110,2022-08-30T20:20:58.220000+00:00,right but prototype is saying that this is what his statement refers to

1115,2022-08-30T20:19:58.090000+00:00,we agree in this super small specific instance
1116,2022-08-30T20:19:43.021000+00:00,okay acceptable
1117,2022-08-30T20:19:27.256000+00:00,"I mean the small sample size, super soft edged ""ux research"""
1118,2022-08-30T20:19:21.733000+00:00,qual vs quant
1119,2022-08-30T20:19:20.390000+00:00,Any qualitative can be turned into a survey after to say something about which groups it applies to
1120,2022-08-30T20:19:16.245000+00:00,wait we already had this convo right?
1121,2022-08-30T20:18:32.802000+00:00,Depends for what you use it still the attitudinal
1122,2022-08-30T20:18:12.962000+00:00,and connecting that to the millions of other things those same people thumbs up and thumbs down'd to feed some recommendation engine
1123,2022-08-30T20:17:14.594000+00:00,like millions of people thumbs up or thumbs downing a video on netflix
1124,2022-08-30T20:16:58.747000+00:00,"I guess for clarification, I don't mean big data"
1125,2022-08-30T20:16:53.880000+00:00,i get what you're saying
1126,2022-08-30T20:16:33.639000+00:00,but quantitative data is equally valuable but not easily accessible
1127,2022-08-30T20:16:13.072000+00:00,its especially bad
1128,2022-08-30T20:16:07.638000+00:00,the affective / attitudinal stuff
1129,2022-08-30T20:15:57.993000+00:00,ux research tends to skew towards qualitative data
1130,2022-08-30T20:15:55.751000+00:00,and for all the things UX people try and use surveys for
1131,2022-08-30T20:15:33.281000+00:00,knowing when and why they're used is part of the specialization
1132,2022-08-30T20:15:24.354000+00:00,Or when the client wants to know more specific number for a very specific choice
1133,2022-08-30T20:15:10.145000+00:00,isn't everything low value except in specific circumstances though üëÄ
1134,2022-08-30T20:14:47.711000+00:00,More for validating things one already heard in interviews
1135,2022-08-30T20:14:32.284000+00:00,except in very specific circumstance
1136,2022-08-30T20:14:15.764000+00:00,NPS/CE11/etc. all low value
1137,2022-08-30T20:13:29.245000+00:00,üíÄ PAIN PROTOTYPE
1138,2022-08-30T20:13:19.532000+00:00,how would you feel if people said illustrators are the same as ux designers
1139,2022-08-30T20:13:11.214000+00:00,Not for UX
1140,2022-08-30T20:12:50.346000+00:00,For market research though
1141,2022-08-30T20:12:43.957000+00:00,We actually often do surveys
1142,2022-08-30T20:12:12.811000+00:00,p a i n

1147,2022-08-30T20:11:54.145000+00:00,BUT FINE
1148,2022-08-30T20:11:46.036000+00:00,not phd researchers
1149,2022-08-30T20:11:42.092000+00:00,well i meant data scientists
1150,2022-08-30T20:11:35.845000+00:00,and surveys are pointless 99% of the time
1151,2022-08-30T20:11:28.436000+00:00,yes. I've worked directly with dozens of phd researchers
1152,2022-08-30T20:11:28.383000+00:00,üëÄ just curious
1153,2022-08-30T20:11:07.452000+00:00,have you?

1155,2022-08-30T20:10:52.424000+00:00,no
1156,2022-08-30T20:10:48.525000+00:00,ok but youll change your mind when someone w survey experience works w you
1157,2022-08-30T20:10:46.095000+00:00,there are a very small number of scenarios where a survey is acceptable
1158,2022-08-30T20:10:22.550000+00:00,pretty bad
1159,2022-08-30T20:10:19.354000+00:00,I mean...
1160,2022-08-30T20:10:13.901000+00:00,surveys are misused but not bad inherently
1161,2022-08-30T20:10:02.534000+00:00,bc adobe xd is just bad software
1162,2022-08-30T20:09:54.392000+00:00,ok not the same
1163,2022-08-30T20:09:44.019000+00:00,the adobe XD of user research
1164,2022-08-30T20:09:42.744000+00:00,<:FrogCoolCry:908837332227080223> ok that too
1165,2022-08-30T20:09:23.745000+00:00,i meant more that it's painful people are conducting surveys
1166,2022-08-30T20:08:15.266000+00:00,nobody even removes their link after the ping from Dyno <:FrogCoolCry:908837332227080223>
1167,2022-08-30T20:08:12.225000+00:00,p a i n
1168,2022-08-30T20:07:29.912000+00:00,üíÄ just a survey channel
1169,2022-08-30T01:10:04.262000+00:00,"Hello <@356144806172295178>, please move your post to <#708809627260944436>. Thank you."
1170,2022-08-29T21:20:35.169000+00:00,"Yeah, focus more on how you plan your test rather than which tools to use."
1171,2022-08-29T21:20:08.088000+00:00,Nice!
1172,2022-08-29T19:00:37.127000+00:00,Sounds good! I'm excited to get going!
1173,2022-08-29T19:00:00.450000+00:00,Yeah no worries! just keep it simple and be creative. No need for fancy tools unless you got a manager paying for them
1174,2022-08-29T18:59:00.973000+00:00,I couldn't help but feel limited from having so many options to do it. If that makes sense.
1175,2022-08-29T18:58:56.199000+00:00,Yeah I'm not sure about others. But where I work recruiting users equals money.
1176,2022-08-29T18:58:00.760000+00:00,"Okay that does clear up a lot of my concerns actually. A lot of my uncertainty was coming from ""is this an acceptable way of doing things?"" etc. Even active recruitment was a question mark in my head"
1177,2022-08-29T18:56:36.410000+00:00,"Unless recruiting is something you wish to practice. But even then, in a professional setting (not in every company) you're going to get budget to pay people to do it for you"
1178,2022-08-29T18:56:01.091000+00:00,Even for a portfolio. Just call them users. Nobody will care.
1179,2022-08-29T18:55:11.713000+00:00,But friends and family can be a good start
1180,2022-08-29T18:53:49.002000+00:00,In a figure of speech...
1181,2022-08-29T18:53:44.919000+00:00,Don't ever say you can't find people until you've individually asked all 40K people on this server.
1182,2022-08-29T18:52:32.510000+00:00,But in any case; active recruitment. Not passive recruitment. Passive recruitment only works if you pay people.
1183,2022-08-29T18:51:17.023000+00:00,"Yeah, also sharing through linkedIn that you're looking for people, helped me quite a lot when I was still studying"
1184,2022-08-29T18:49:50.829000+00:00,"Alright, I'll definitely exercise all my options then. Thank you for your insights and advice!"
1185,2022-08-29T18:49:41.801000+00:00,But with more likelyhood of them saying yes
1186,2022-08-29T18:49:30.546000+00:00,It's like asking someone on a date
1187,2022-08-29T18:49:25.464000+00:00,Just be social
1188,2022-08-29T18:49:01.630000+00:00,Well you could. But that;s the thing. Doing it through a survey is expecting them to come to you. You can try it of course.
1189,2022-08-29T18:48:32.154000+00:00,"Okay, sounds good! Is this something I can ask in the survey recruitment channel? I'm a bit new to this community"
1190,2022-08-29T18:48:18.482000+00:00,And not expect participants to come to you
1191,2022-08-29T18:48:03.527000+00:00,Comes down to being social and actively asking people
1192,2022-08-29T18:47:50.272000+00:00,"But nope, no place to pull free participants beside hustling for them yourself"
1193,2022-08-29T18:47:27.252000+00:00,It's for a portfolio project
1194,2022-08-29T18:46:53.285000+00:00,"If it's for practice, then friends and family doesn't matter. It not being representative doesn't really matter if there's no 'real' choices being made or a teacher trying to see how representative you are."
1195,2022-08-29T18:45:24.232000+00:00,For participants it kind of depends on the nature of the project
1196,2022-08-29T18:44:59.356000+00:00,"I'd stay away from unmoderated. Seems like the more time efficient method, but you're going to have to watch the entire thing anyway, so is not going to be faster."
1197,2022-08-29T18:44:35.044000+00:00,Or any resources for participants I can pull from for free?
1198,2022-08-29T18:43:48.166000+00:00,"Sounds good! Now as for recruiting participants, is there a best practice tied to that? I basically just have friends and family in mind at the moment."
1199,2022-08-29T18:42:40.225000+00:00,You can prepare a question guide for every separate task
1200,2022-08-29T18:42:18.060000+00:00,Task and scenarios will define the structure
1201,2022-08-29T18:41:53.423000+00:00,E.g ‚Äúsearch for cookies‚Äù
1202,2022-08-29T18:41:38.993000+00:00,So after each task you stop and introduce the next task
1203,2022-08-29T18:41:27.033000+00:00,Basically do tasks
1204,2022-08-29T18:41:04.406000+00:00,"I see. That definitely simplifies things a bit, guess I was just overthinking it. Thank you Dario!

Then I would just read out the prompts to them as they go along, and try not to intervene best I can?"
1205,2022-08-29T18:39:36.481000+00:00,"But for many things, just zoom, teams or hangout works just fine"
1206,2022-08-29T18:38:52.654000+00:00,Unless you want it to be a repository
1207,2022-08-29T18:38:27.318000+00:00,You don‚Äôt really need specialised tools for usability tests
1208,2022-08-29T18:38:07.784000+00:00,Well you‚Äôd just do it in Google hangout and let them share their screen / or watch theirs by clicking on their name in figma and record
1209,2022-08-29T18:37:11.147000+00:00,Unmoderated was my first option. Would my options differ if I opt to change the study for a moderated usability test instead?
1210,2022-08-29T18:36:50.854000+00:00,"As in, you will not be moderating the usability tests?"
1211,2022-08-29T18:35:16.640000+00:00,Oh unmoderated tools?
1212,2022-08-29T18:34:04.349000+00:00,"The meeting tool mostly. I can look for participants manually if anything, but it would be nice if I had a tool that would just show the prompts for the user as they go along. Recording option necessary as well, for notes. The option to have video on for participants would be a nice-to-have."
1213,2022-08-29T18:32:32.399000+00:00,"The prototyping tool, the meeting tool, finding people tool?"
1214,2022-08-29T18:31:56.762000+00:00,What exactly are you looking for in the option?
1215,2022-08-29T18:29:23.235000+00:00,"Hey guys, I'm looking to run a usability test for a rough first prototype for a student project. The options I have found seem to just be paid. My question is: What are my best options for conducting a usability test for a web app, completely free? Any recommendations?"

1248,2022-08-22T16:38:02.788000+00:00,than shooting out for random opinions and hoping one of them is a good one
1249,2022-08-22T16:37:53.776000+00:00,its far more directional in terms of process
1250,2022-08-22T16:37:42.290000+00:00,"so you might as well just make an educated guess, and follow it up with research activities that validate your guess"
1251,2022-08-22T16:37:28.033000+00:00,"and if you're a student and this is a hobby project, you're probably never going to get a sample size large enough to be statistically significant"
1252,2022-08-22T16:36:44.229000+00:00,"as soon as someone says confidence intervals, my eyes glaze over"
1253,2022-08-22T16:36:16.879000+00:00,"I'll add additionally.. since I'm here.. survey design requires math üíÄ and about 99% of people will go WHAT!? which means they don't know how to design surveys. 

survey design is not about just writing the right questions. It is about being able to calculate correlations and measure responses."
1254,2022-08-22T16:36:09.177000+00:00,like 15 minutes of effort vs 12 hours of effort
1255,2022-08-22T16:35:55.641000+00:00,"vs. spending dozens of hours writing a survey, sourcing respondents, collecting data, parsing data to look for trends, etc."
1256,2022-08-22T16:35:36.554000+00:00,"There's also a very good chance that any data you get out of a survey, is something you already knew, or represents a conclusion that you could arrive at just by doing some critical thinking"
1257,2022-08-22T16:35:05.214000+00:00,"If you asked 50 americans where new hampshire was, you'd probably get 25 different answers. Does that make the answer with the most responses the correct one, because most people said it?"
1258,2022-08-22T16:34:24.264000+00:00,"and the big broad attitudinal surveys like likerts don't have any observational data at all. its just opinions by random people, shouted into the air."
1259,2022-08-22T16:33:50.951000+00:00,"Surveys are too unspecific. They collect very surface level information that you cannot easily follow up on in the moment. If the respondent says something useful, you can't ask them any follow up questions about it when their response is top-of-mind."
1260,2022-08-22T16:32:46.039000+00:00,I guess I'll do a serious response to balance out my flagrant abuse of google forms.

1293,2022-08-22T13:25:41.886000+00:00,by doing the user review research I hope to take design-related issues that users have and build a design that resolves the pain points. I plan to an online survey alongside it which will be distributed to social media and that
1294,2022-08-22T12:49:37.211000+00:00,So long story short; the impact the pain has on the behaviour
1295,2022-08-22T12:48:25.505000+00:00,"Though if it doesn‚Äôt influence their behaviour: e.g finding a new e-mail platform, or easily solve it by returning it to the previous version. It may not be worth solving"
1296,2022-08-22T12:46:33.190000+00:00,"People like to complain, like with the new Gmail UI"
1297,2022-08-22T12:40:20.026000+00:00,If they‚Äôre already looking for solution to solve it
1298,2022-08-22T08:33:32.480000+00:00,"While I don't have friends/family in New Jersey (where this project is based) my question 8 and some feedback on reddit did give me some insight on why ""zones""  is a pain point for people as they wrote their personal experience with it. I guess my question now is how do I know when a pain point is worth fixing?"
1299,2022-08-21T22:38:46.730000+00:00,What is your goal though? What do you hope to get out of doing this research? Because it‚Äôs hard to give advice if we don‚Äôt know what you‚Äôre working towards.
1300,2022-08-21T22:34:53.231000+00:00,"Generally bad reviews are about technical problems though, things the devs need to fix"
1301,2022-08-21T22:33:59.777000+00:00,You can analyse reviews though. Kind of depends what you really want to learn from it.
1302,2022-08-21T22:32:55.182000+00:00,"If you can‚Äôt find 1 person for an interview, how do you expect to find many people for a survey?"
1303,2022-08-21T22:32:23.924000+00:00,However for your question
1304,2022-08-21T22:31:58.188000+00:00,"But yeah, falls under desk research I suppose"
1305,2022-08-21T22:31:07.278000+00:00,"Just collecting data by itself isn‚Äôt ‚Äòresearch‚Äô in that sense, because you need to conclude something based on data. Not just take a review at face value."
1306,2022-08-21T22:30:43.659000+00:00,A user review is data I suppose
1307,2022-08-21T21:10:02.915000+00:00,i take it user reviews fall under desk research right?
1308,2022-08-21T20:32:59.788000+00:00,They forgot desk research <:SweatCat:874151369035100180>

1313,2022-08-20T09:46:24.849000+00:00,+1 on this. interview is a go to method for discovery as you need to be able to follow through with questions. some answers from the participants  might be new or something that you as a researcher haven't considered so probing is needed.
1314,2022-08-18T12:37:12.738000+00:00,"So I‚Äôd suggest to do interviews instead. Interview your friends / family if you have to, even that is better than a survey in this situation"
1315,2022-08-18T12:35:15.997000+00:00,"You‚Äôre using the wrong method for this. You can‚Äôt use surveys for discovering pain points, because to find pain points you need to be able to ask follow up questions. And if something is a pain points, you need to know the implications of that pain points, because a pain point by itself doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs worth solving."

1324,2022-08-09T19:27:15.835000+00:00,thank you!
1325,2022-08-09T19:23:38.670000+00:00,If it‚Äôs just about ‚Äòusability‚Äô then those heuristics is all you need
1326,2022-08-09T19:22:58.439000+00:00,So you could say we want to re-design it specifically for accessibility or specifically for a highly personalised experience
1327,2022-08-09T19:22:07.384000+00:00,However re-design may also be ‚Äòvalue‚Äô based
1328,2022-08-09T19:20:54.374000+00:00,You say a re-design so then heuristics may prove to be very useful
1329,2022-08-09T19:18:18.623000+00:00,What do you hope to gain from doing so?
1330,2022-08-09T19:17:54.480000+00:00,We can compare different boba tea apps a 100 different ways
1331,2022-08-09T19:17:22.331000+00:00,You may want to define what you really want to get out of this research first

1335,2022-08-09T18:58:59.955000+00:00,ive done things like user interviews/surveys for a case study before but im not familiar with how exactly user feedback is gathered for redesigns is that where heuristics are used?
1336,2022-08-09T18:57:57.577000+00:00,is heuristics something i as the designer would research myself or is it also important to get user feedback for this part?
1337,2022-08-09T18:55:20.545000+00:00,Transparency in communication
1338,2022-08-09T18:55:09.670000+00:00,For example; how well does the the pick-up feature keep the user 'updated' about the pick-up could be a possible one
1339,2022-08-09T18:53:57.738000+00:00,You could use heuristics for example
1340,2022-08-09T18:53:26.763000+00:00,"Depends, how do you want to find out which one users find easier to use?"
1341,2022-08-09T18:53:07.133000+00:00,Pick-up feature could be a good feature yeah
1342,2022-08-09T18:52:27.737000+00:00,same metric as in if both apps have a pick up feature then see which one users find easier to use?
1343,2022-08-09T18:51:43.491000+00:00,"food ordering apps, specifically for boba tea"
1344,2022-08-09T18:43:35.913000+00:00,What kind of apps are they?
1345,2022-08-09T18:43:29.817000+00:00,"You need to compare them on the same metric. So not really see which pro and con they have, more like, which app scores better on specific measurable metric than the other?"
1346,2022-08-09T18:23:19.925000+00:00,"hi everyone, im conducting my first redesign for an app and im currently working on the competitive analysis part. my question is if im comparing the app to its competitor is it required that i find both pros/cons in the competitor app? so far ive made a list of what what the other app does better/how they do it/why users like it but im having trouble finding cons in the app. obviously no app is perfect but are cons required?"

I'm not getting a whole lot of traction in finding things though. Any suggestions for better search terms? Let me know if this should go in the ux/ui design channel instead
1360,2022-08-09T00:01:20.978000+00:00,"Would anyone have recommendations they can share for synthesizing data from a usability test? This is my first test for a project that I'm working on at my new job, and I want to share my findings with my team.

1365,2022-08-06T08:40:48.115000+00:00,Just an example how to further scope your user
1366,2022-08-06T08:40:38.109000+00:00,Then the problem becomes very concrete. A payment app that doesn't require you to be able to read.
1367,2022-08-06T08:39:58.490000+00:00,In India this could be an even more interesting case study... As you can see a major reason why some of these apps aren't used is because some of the street vendors are illiterate
1368,2022-08-06T08:37:36.195000+00:00,That really helps to help you think of themes for your own research

1373,2022-08-06T08:35:16.483000+00:00,"Before you do that it might help doing secondary research, to see what's already there"
1374,2022-08-06T08:25:31.479000+00:00,"With any problem or pain it's important to ask for the implications of that problem, or whether they've ever attempted to solve it. Because if they have never attempted to solve it, then they will never look for your app to solve it either. Especially if they never used any app, nor looked for any, they are not fit for the interview."
1375,2022-08-06T08:24:11.040000+00:00,"Pains and gains are easiest to find, when you start digging further to the goals of these apps, the added value they bring. And then someway turn that around to see whether there are times the 'goal' or added value has not been met due to some specific thing."
1376,2022-08-06T08:21:23.910000+00:00,"Heyo,

There's some different routes you could take. I guess the main question you'd really want to know is; **why would street vendors look for a new  payment app?** Your audience is just street vendors, this audience can be scoped further when you know more about them. So in that sense the best thing would be to start interviewing street vendors. 

What helps me setting up interview guides is first starting with some 'themes'. For example. Very high over you could think: **Current situation** and **desired situation**. Then you'd first need to very well know the current situation. 

Current situation of payment apps in general
- Current tech use
- Context of tech use
- Gains of use (problems the tech solves)
- Pains of use

So if for these themes you'd need to think of questions. Some examples

Current tech use
- What is your experience with payment apps?
- Do you use them a lot? 
- Which payment apps are you currently using? (If they use any at all)
    - (if not) Have you ever tried any?
    - (If not) Why not?
- Which payment apps have you tried?
- Why did you choose your current one over the others? 

Context of use
- Could you tell me more about the last time your used the app?
- Where were you? 
- What was the time of the day?
- What did you try to achieve using that app?
- Why did you need an app for that?"
1377,2022-08-06T03:46:26.518000+00:00,"Well usually when you have less than 40 people on a survey it is not a representative sample, no? Because I am conducting a research on the accessibility of podcasts and got around 20 people and since I haven‚Äôt gotten any more then I thought I could still get my point across through already existing studies and sources üôÇ"
1378,2022-08-05T20:50:56.976000+00:00,For some more background its for a mobile payment app for local street vendors

1380,2022-08-05T20:24:10.585000+00:00,"Hey everyone, I'm starting my first project on the Google UX course and i was hoping someone can give me some advice on how to approach ux research. This is my first project so I'm not sure how to come up with research goals, how to define my audience, and how to come up with interview questions."
1381,2022-08-05T04:54:59.746000+00:00,Depends. Valid for whom and as what / for which purpose or question?
1382,2022-08-04T16:32:39.645000+00:00,"Hi everyone! I have a  question, I am currently working on a accessibility case study and because I do not have much access to a specific target group (because I was running a quantitative survey and I don't have a high enough number for it to have statistical significance) I was doing more of the typical academic research (going through research papers, international data, etc). Because I have never seen this type of research on any case study I was wondering if this is still valid as the research phase for  my case study?

Thank you ‚ù§Ô∏è"

1386,2022-08-04T14:52:27.033000+00:00,LOL true
1387,2022-08-04T14:50:08.208000+00:00,"It being clearly better is an assumption, and if that was certain why test at all?"
1388,2022-08-04T14:47:50.830000+00:00,Kind of depends what you hope to get out of it too.
1389,2022-08-04T14:47:13.180000+00:00,Why not show both at once? In theory it's not really an A/B test. More like a preference test
1390,2022-08-04T14:45:06.427000+00:00,"Ooo I see. I guess my worry was that the proposed design visually is clearly better than our current design, so I was wondering if the order would affect their bias / preference"
1391,2022-08-04T14:43:27.849000+00:00,I don't see how it would make a difference. In essence they're just two different designs. It being proposed or current isn't an effect of the stimuli. All you're doing is anchoring a bias in the other direction.
1392,2022-08-04T14:35:41.391000+00:00,"*In other words, would you show participants the current design -> proposed design, or proposed design -> current design?"
1393,2022-08-04T14:34:57.323000+00:00,"Hey everyone! Hypothetical situation: Let's say you only have the resources to run one A/B test, and due to functionality constraints you're only able to show the participants version A first, and then version B second. If version A is the current design, and version B is the proposed redesign, which order would you present it to participants in?"

1395,2022-08-04T12:58:02.918000+00:00,It may give you hints where to look. But it will not be sufficient enough to give you anything more than a hint of the direction the smell is coming from.
1396,2022-08-04T12:56:49.881000+00:00,You still need to identify the cause of a bad smell in hope to reduce it.
1397,2022-08-04T12:56:16.704000+00:00,It's like a bad smell coming from somewhere.
1398,2022-08-04T12:55:27.695000+00:00,"But no. Definitely not a substitute. This kind of data is usually used to serve the function of 'trends', so rather as a reason to start an interview."

Like in design people can just take on some restaurant that wants a new website and they don‚Äôt want to pay 15K so they take a starting freelancer because they‚Äôre cheap. Thus easy to start as a freelancer if you work for 15 times as cheap‚Ä¶

UXR is going to be very hard to sell in that same light, because there is no direct result and no direct need from low budget companies."

1440,2022-08-01T20:21:29.374000+00:00,"I suggest starting from ""what is the goal of this project"". Is it to produce a great design portfolio case study? a research case study? Or is it to sharpen and refine your research skills? If it's for UX design project, consider identifying a smaller but crucial problem with a good amount of insights for you to work on and showcase your UX design skills."
1441,2022-08-01T20:21:12.098000+00:00,"Understanding and doing research is great in general for a designer, but specifically for a design portfolio just put your effort into the part your design hiring managers would want to focus on (then do more detailed research as a side project, if you want!)"

1488,2022-08-01T19:58:50.703000+00:00,Going over this I was recommended to do a diary study since I cannot observe participants in real time. I was thinking of reaching out to my old work colleagues and giving them compensation. The participant limit = my personal budget.
1489,2022-08-01T18:59:35.002000+00:00,If you‚Äôre looking to practice UXR it might be more effective to start with users you can reach üëÄ
1490,2022-08-01T16:40:17.049000+00:00,"I'm wondering if my idea is also too broad üòÖ it's kind of like *if I could make my day and my team members easier, what would we do?*"
1491,2022-08-01T16:38:58.172000+00:00,"The idea is there would be somewhere that says that was checked off, still pending, or cancelled. Sometimes team members are missing at the start of the day (called off, stuck in traffic) and everyone is so busy with their own things including the manager. It can change the entire day."
1492,2022-08-01T16:33:39.938000+00:00,Often times in the OR you need momentum and the moment a task is* forgotten/overdue the whole team can come to a halt.
1493,2022-08-01T16:32:28.668000+00:00,"My idea would be like enterprise software solution - meant to solve multiple problems.

Managers to fill in details that often are printed out (or written by hand) or areas of miscommunication because there are pending status of multiple things."
1494,2022-08-01T16:27:51.656000+00:00,"I would follow up with them on a single problem, and try to gain as much context as you can for that specific problem"
1495,2022-08-01T16:26:32.189000+00:00,"It was very unstructured interview I just let them talk and only asked if they can expand on the main ""actions"""
1496,2022-08-01T16:25:52.221000+00:00,I created my own journey map then I ask how their day looks like and checked off things that matched - added things that are different experiences for them
1497,2022-08-01T16:25:11.285000+00:00,Gotcha yeah which I already did two interviews with my old colleagues ü§î
1498,2022-08-01T16:24:44.618000+00:00,"If you have a general idea of what the problem is you want to solve, start there and validate it with an interview or two with someone in that profession"
1499,2022-08-01T16:24:24.449000+00:00,"When it comes to presenting how I arrived at this information I don't want the answer to be like ""yeah it came out of my memories"" üòÖ because I already did that for my first project."
1500,2022-08-01T16:24:06.659000+00:00,"Infact that last part might be the most important, the person reading your case study doesn't care how important the problem is. They care about how good your solution is."
1501,2022-08-01T16:23:40.721000+00:00,"I would consider it like this--for a fictional case study, it doesn't matter that the problem you're solving is the *most important problem* it just matters that it is a problem that really exists, that you can solve."
1502,2022-08-01T16:22:24.351000+00:00,"I see. My mock project is to create something that makes communication about the status of patients and cases easier.

I wanted to approach it broadly because I'm not sure if I'm being too biased as an ex-operating room worker. I know what the flow of the day looks like for the professionals and how they do things."
1503,2022-08-01T16:17:59.392000+00:00,"You're starting too broad. You simply are never going to have enough data to tackle a case study from this angle. It's always going to boil up to just making an assumption, and very likely one you could have made without spending this much effort.

> My goal is to find patterns for their biggest challenges and how they perform certain actions."
1504,2022-08-01T16:14:16.200000+00:00,"For my portfolio project I don't have access to healthcare workers in the way that I want where ideally I would follow their day and observe how they do things.

My current plan is to:
-Watch YouTube videos with the ""day in my life as X""
-Print out transcript and highlight themes (very easy to copy and paste - I'm going to double check for transcript errors)
-Create a thematic affinity diagram

My goal is to find patterns for their biggest challenges and how they perform certain actions."
1505,2022-08-01T07:53:22.062000+00:00,Bit more accessible than just colors
1506,2022-08-01T07:53:15.789000+00:00,Could also do it with smiley faces
1507,2022-08-01T07:46:32.919000+00:00,"Then for each part - like 'Registration' for example, you set each competitor against each other with the same metrics"
1508,2022-08-01T07:45:29.755000+00:00,Then for this we did: Registration > Orientation > Check-out > Order-status

1519,2022-07-25T16:15:12.061000+00:00,"Though one compares markets, the other compares products (or product experiences)"
1520,2022-07-25T16:11:37.901000+00:00,We can do both competitive analysis in market and in UXR
1521,2022-07-25T16:11:08.277000+00:00,"Market is research is an umbrella term, like UX research basically"
1522,2022-07-25T15:15:00.036000+00:00,"Yeah I think this is what I‚Äôm looking for. I think I got my terminology confused, and it just isn‚Äôt called competitive analysis. Maybe market research is a better term. Just to ensure that the problems the users are telling me about can‚Äôt already be solved by an existing product."

1544,2022-07-25T01:16:34.791000+00:00,"Competitive analysis question- I‚Äôm struggling with what the focus should be during the beginning of the design process. Is it supposed to be just to ensure there is a real need for the product (I.e. it‚Äôs worth the time and money to create) and that said product isn‚Äôt too similar to the others, or is competitive analysis already the place to start comparing features with an eye towards which exact features to include in the new product? Or is that supposed to be done in a second competitive analysis later on, when the product‚Äôs features are being nailed down?"

1567,2022-07-12T10:56:57.420000+00:00,will definitely keep all the things youve mentioned in mind. thank you for such a great discussion!
1568,2022-07-12T10:51:57.578000+00:00,So you'd really need to know. How will the result - positive or negative - impact which decision?
1569,2022-07-12T10:44:01.825000+00:00,"If you also however have other data, like analytics, then it can suddenly be useful"
1570,2022-07-12T10:40:21.534000+00:00,Thereby it's also perception. Thus the experienced difficulty to navigate could just be a by-product of some other underlaying issue that doesn't have to do with navigation.
1571,2022-07-12T10:38:17.528000+00:00,"Yea problem with SUS doesn't really tell why, or how to increase. It just helps to point in some direction for follow-up research."
1572,2022-07-12T10:36:43.975000+00:00,"-if the sus is for the entire system, then once it fails, it's difficult to point where to enhance.
- if there's a scope (features in the system), it would be easier to know where and what to enhance"
1573,2022-07-12T10:35:08.343000+00:00,okay so the important aspect is to actually have a scope.
1574,2022-07-12T10:34:54.986000+00:00,"it would be to increase it. but then again, without the UT, i wouldnt know where to begin... i get it now haha"
1575,2022-07-12T10:26:43.427000+00:00,"Depends what you want to do with it. If the SUS fails, what action do you want to take?"
1576,2022-07-12T09:50:17.777000+00:00,without a user test üòÖ
1577,2022-07-12T09:46:50.574000+00:00,"Without a scope you mean, or just without a user test?"
1578,2022-07-12T09:42:55.746000+00:00,"but with that, would it also make sense to do the SUS for the entire software? like just the survey alone with no UT attached to it."
1579,2022-07-12T09:42:14.847000+00:00,hmm this makes sense. so it would also be clearer which to enhance.
1580,2022-07-12T09:41:24.904000+00:00,Then it's important to set up a scope of use in they survey I suppose. SUS relating to specific actions
1581,2022-07-12T09:40:06.465000+00:00,the participants are recruited from our pool of clients. they should be using our software
1582,2022-07-12T09:38:24.615000+00:00,As in; what is the source of the recruitment
1583,2022-07-12T09:37:31.169000+00:00,How are you doing they survey? Is it an intercept survey?
1584,2022-07-12T09:37:17.600000+00:00,Well mostly vague. As I imagine you'll have no idea which parts of the entire system are the ones causing it.
1585,2022-07-12T09:35:06.116000+00:00,"so ive tried using 1 - 2 features of the sytem for the UT, then did an SUS after it. But the SUS (standard questions)  is more of for the entire system. would that make the results inaccurate on some level?"
1586,2022-07-12T09:34:16.980000+00:00,"Well, you can also do it in order to scope the usability test after the SUS I suppose."
1587,2022-07-12T09:33:39.143000+00:00,im not inclined to do that as it would not be an efficient use of time.
1588,2022-07-12T09:33:10.196000+00:00,"my only issue here is that, if administered with UT, then the tasks / scenarios would have to be geared towards the entire software."
1589,2022-07-12T09:32:15.845000+00:00,"Yeah, that's also possible."
1590,2022-07-12T09:32:00.205000+00:00,For example; the more aesthetic a UI the higher the perception of usability.
1591,2022-07-12T09:31:52.410000+00:00,this might be a question for another day for me. right now i want to get a baseline perception from our clients.
1592,2022-07-12T09:31:17.949000+00:00,So that's why it's useful to do both a test and questionnaire
1593,2022-07-12T09:30:55.036000+00:00,So the interesting thing is usually: where does the perception of usability and actual usability contrast?
1594,2022-07-12T09:30:12.762000+00:00,"Also keep in mind a SUS measures the perception of usability, not the usability"
1595,2022-07-12T09:29:55.941000+00:00,Depends if the product is already live and widely used.
1596,2022-07-12T09:29:14.954000+00:00,do they always go hand in hand or i can just look for survey participants for the SUS alone?
1597,2022-07-12T09:28:36.702000+00:00,usability testing
1598,2022-07-12T09:28:27.528000+00:00,ah bless you. thank you!
1599,2022-07-12T09:28:27.482000+00:00,User test?
1600,2022-07-12T09:28:24.721000+00:00,What do you mean with UT?
1601,2022-07-12T09:28:05.870000+00:00,You could see if https://measuringu.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Lewis_Sauro_HCII2009.pdf has some things to say about it
1602,2022-07-12T09:26:46.703000+00:00,Hello.  Has anyone  done a SUS rating? was wondering if anyone has resource on how to efficiently run it. Like does SUS always need a UT first?

1606,2022-07-10T18:12:50.277000+00:00,But binary metrics often take only 40 people or so
1607,2022-07-10T18:01:36.122000+00:00,"You actually need 1200, as 2/3 will be screened out"
1608,2022-07-10T18:01:10.122000+00:00,And if you know 1/3 people have dogs and you need 400 people for statistical significance
1609,2022-07-10T18:00:04.303000+00:00,"So if you just want to talk to people with dogs, the sample size only counts for people with dogs"
1610,2022-07-10T17:59:22.305000+00:00,Usually you also have to deal with incidence rate
1611,2022-07-10T17:56:02.286000+00:00,Yeah it depends what you need to tell your PM
1612,2022-07-10T17:03:31.279000+00:00,Ahhh I think I get it. Thanks for the examples it helped a lot!!
1613,2022-07-10T16:59:46.467000+00:00,Thanks for the link! Looks really interesting <:BlobThanks:853500879167684628>
1614,2022-07-10T08:55:13.840000+00:00,Probably people better at stats than me though
1615,2022-07-10T08:47:05.931000+00:00,So long story short; amount of people will influence how ‚Äòrepresentative‚Äô your sample is of to the group of people you‚Äôre trying to research. Then the precision requires for your question influences how representative you really need to be in order to answer it.
1616,2022-07-10T08:37:59.830000+00:00,"80% confidence would be too low to learn anything, because the 20% margin is higher than the difference of balls. Thus the question ‚Äúare there more red or blue balls‚Äù can‚Äôt be answered"
1617,2022-07-10T08:37:46.391000+00:00,If there were more like 230 red balls and 270 blue balls
1618,2022-07-10T08:36:31.938000+00:00,However
1619,2022-07-10T08:35:48.646000+00:00,Which is a confidence lvl high enough to at least say ‚Äúthere are more blue balls than red ones‚Äù
1620,2022-07-10T08:35:12.532000+00:00,So if we were to find out the proportion is 4 / 5 with 80% confidence it could also be 3 / 5
1621,2022-07-10T08:28:49.182000+00:00,"If we got a box with 500 balls, 400 blue ones and 100 red ones, we can use probability theory to calculate how much balls we need to look at to guess the proportion of blue and red balls"
1622,2022-07-10T08:27:35.144000+00:00,And why we can do that with only a part of people has to with representiveness
1623,2022-07-10T08:26:41.282000+00:00,"Where medicine aims for 95% confidence, ux can get away with lower depending on the study"
1624,2022-07-10T08:26:09.802000+00:00,So how many people we need is also dependent on how much precision we want
1625,2022-07-10T08:22:03.402000+00:00,The answer would lay between 25% and 55%
1626,2022-07-10T08:21:07.511000+00:00,And you were to repeat the same study with the same representative group (though other people)
1627,2022-07-10T08:20:18.410000+00:00,This means if 40% people answer they own at least 1 dog
1628,2022-07-10T08:19:13.927000+00:00,So if you have 300 participants and let‚Äôs say this gives you 85% confidence (which isn‚Äôt necessarily so)
1629,2022-07-10T08:15:49.770000+00:00,It matter to in which precision you can tell something about a group of people
1630,2022-07-10T05:27:56.107000+00:00,that being said it probably depends on your company and how rigorously they're doing ux research? <:0_jz_db_misspinki_sip:936803387129864273>  curious to hear from an actual researcher
1631,2022-07-10T05:24:33.840000+00:00,"i'm not a researcher but from a laymans perspective i'd imagine you're looking at sample sizes, confidence levels etc. https://www.surveymonkey.com/mp/sample-size-calculator/"
1632,2022-07-10T04:15:36.832000+00:00,"Hey Design Buddies! Does anyone have any advice for how to justify / explain survey participation in relation to the target population? For example, let‚Äôs say your target audience demographic is ‚Äúpeople who own at least one dog‚Äù and there‚Äôs 10000 in your country that have at least one dog. You send out a survey and you get back 300 participants. Your stakeholder/PM/boss comes back and asks ‚ÄúDoes 300 survey responses really matter?‚Äù How would you respond to that?"
1633,2022-07-08T03:53:04.098000+00:00,You would have to rerun the research
1634,2022-07-08T03:52:57.553000+00:00,When you have already sorted insights and etc you won‚Äôt be able to regroup the data in other perspectives
1635,2022-07-08T03:48:36.931000+00:00,Thank you for the reply üôÇ sorry im a bit confused. what do you mean it wont be useful for the future?
1636,2022-07-08T00:01:20.881000+00:00,Their recruitment often is way better and more broad and their stuff is nicely summarized but then getting raw data that is useful for future use is not possible
1637,2022-07-07T09:40:23.403000+00:00,Has anyone done or would like to cooperate in research on defi platforms?
1638,2022-07-07T07:46:47.936000+00:00,"Hey guys, I was wondering if anyone has experience in outsourcing ux testing? how was it? and what did you take away from it?"
1639,2022-07-06T19:12:00.639000+00:00,It's terribly empty
1640,2022-07-06T19:11:51.663000+00:00,Well feel free to place questions in this channel whenever you have them
1641,2022-07-06T19:05:10.197000+00:00,This was incredibly incredibly helpful
1642,2022-07-06T18:51:34.552000+00:00,Then you don't have to worry about all the statistical significance of that problem
1643,2022-07-06T18:50:58.144000+00:00,"However, it's a far easier place to just start with qualitative usability testing. Because then with 5 people you at least have the biggest usability problems in scope."
1644,2022-07-06T18:46:38.102000+00:00,"For example, if you confidence is only 70%, the change in metric needs to be at least either 30% higher or lower to be judged as 'significant'"
1645,2022-07-06T18:45:04.362000+00:00,"For example; doing a quant usability test with 20 people (which gives you a low confidence). Then even with a low confidence, you can calculate whether a specific 'change' in variant (like A/B) is statistically significant"
1646,2022-07-06T18:43:54.587000+00:00,"Or well, I suppose you still can."
1647,2022-07-06T18:43:13.208000+00:00,"If you don't have access to the amount of people quant needs, it's kind of hard to practice."
1648,2022-07-06T18:42:41.589000+00:00,"The big con with starting with quant though, is like the name indicates."
1649,2022-07-06T18:41:51.986000+00:00,Good one to start out with is usability testing. One of the easier and practical ones.
1650,2022-07-06T18:41:22.735000+00:00,Then slowly work up from there
1651,2022-07-06T18:41:13.496000+00:00,I see so many different types of research so I was thinking to at least get better at conducting a handful
1652,2022-07-06T18:39:39.291000+00:00,Why do you want to choose a focus?
1653,2022-07-06T18:39:25.059000+00:00,Thank you Dario üëã
1654,2022-07-06T18:39:14.780000+00:00,Hmm okay I think I'll try my hand at both and choose a focus from there
1655,2022-07-06T18:38:06.108000+00:00,"Quantitative is generally considered the harder one to learn. Because you need some good math skills, statistics and all."
1656,2022-07-06T18:38:04.792000+00:00,Ahh okay okay
1657,2022-07-06T18:36:55.053000+00:00,"Personally I have a qualitative focus, but I still do quant from time to time."
1658,2022-07-06T18:36:21.384000+00:00,There are specific job needs for both of them.
1659,2022-07-06T18:35:58.540000+00:00,"Uhhh, doesn't really matter a whole lot. I'd choose which you have best potential to be good at."
1660,2022-07-06T18:35:20.926000+00:00,Would you recommend a focus on Quantitative Research vs Qualitative? It seems most places are looking for qualitative skills
1661,2022-07-06T18:34:36.802000+00:00,High! üëã
1662,2022-07-06T18:34:24.791000+00:00,"I'm Mykhy, a UXR-in training just saying highüëãüèº"
1663,2022-07-06T18:33:57.498000+00:00,"Hey guys, I'm sorry to jump in here"
1664,2022-07-06T18:33:25.393000+00:00,"Though the main point of impact she also talks about is that of politics. It's a great workshop to try and increase the popularity of research in a company, or to make people understand its need and hopefully increase the UXR's that will get hired to meet the increasing demand."
1665,2022-07-06T18:21:54.955000+00:00,"However, biased insights will still be the main issue"
1666,2022-07-06T18:20:59.367000+00:00,"I guess the place where it saves time, is that you as only researcher at a company (in her case) can do 6 separate prototypes (or problem statements) , and have 6 separate reports in one session. It's not the process that's faster, it's that it's synchronous, so the same process has more output. As in their case, they would have to make a separate test script for each individual. Because the questions are not about one problem statement, but different ones."
1667,2022-07-06T16:44:22.447000+00:00,"This is pitched as being time-efficient, but looking at the Rapid Research Process timeline, the researcher still has to review request forms and design the entire research plan as normal. Dots one though six are a pretty normal workflow. 

The novel part begins at dot seven, with the researcher training other team members to be moderators. This is a non-trivial, non-scalable task requiring a large time investment from everyone involved (researcher for putting together the learning material and answering individual questions and moderators for learning the material.) This also requires everyone to do dry runs and additional practice. 

The researcher still does the participant recruiting. Even though the timeline has the Speed Dating as a team-only thing, in the article the researcher describes themselves being present (which makes sense and is likely necessary to resolve any issues) so the researcher is still there for the user testing. 

The researcher then meets with the teams and helps them formulate how their report will look, and the teams do the final report-writing. Depending on organizational incentives, these reports may be very biased and probably need to be reviewed by the researcher at the end for validity. 

So, in essence, this is a normal UXR workflow that is exclusively more work for both the researcher and the organization as a whole and likely results in lower-quality data and less accurate conclusions. As an educational workshop-type exercise, this could be great. The participants from your organization learn something about research and their own product, kind of. As an efficient, time-saving workflow as pitched in the article? Not so much, at least going by what the article presents. As almost everything in this workflow requires some form of linearly-scaling time investment on the part of the researcher, this workflow does not ""scale...across a wide range of projects"" like the article writer claims."
1668,2022-07-06T09:38:57.576000+00:00,
1669,2022-07-06T09:17:30.335000+00:00,Very unorthodox approach I suppose

1671,2022-07-06T09:09:32.426000+00:00,Only big con being the research will be more biased; because they're not trained researchers
1672,2022-07-06T09:09:07.064000+00:00,And speed date between them
1673,2022-07-06T09:09:01.455000+00:00,Which means you can research 6 people at once
1674,2022-07-06T09:07:42.402000+00:00,And the respomnsibility of the UXR will be training them
1675,2022-07-06T09:07:25.974000+00:00,"So the developers, data scientist, designers do their own research"
1676,2022-07-06T09:02:49.966000+00:00,They're doing research with multiple team members (also including non researchers)
1677,2022-07-06T08:53:59.355000+00:00,Interesting approach
1678,2022-07-03T21:05:19.392000+00:00,True. Thank you!
1679,2022-07-03T11:55:36.428000+00:00,"Well, one is more specific than the other. We can test more than usability with users. Concept testing is also user testing. Preference testing is also user testing."

1685,2022-06-30T20:54:46.977000+00:00,"Like we could also put a small questionnaire after a card sort, that doesn‚Äôt make it a survey"
1686,2022-06-30T20:46:24.688000+00:00,"So a questionnaire is simply a set of questions aimed at an individual, surveys a questionnaire aimed to gain insights about different groups of people"
1687,2022-06-30T20:44:06.721000+00:00,"So a survey often contains a questionnaire, but a questionnaire doesn‚Äôt have to be a survey"
1688,2022-06-30T20:43:08.882000+00:00,A survey is more the method of doing a questionnaire
1689,2022-06-30T20:36:00.173000+00:00,is there a difference between surveys and questionnaires?
1690,2022-06-29T20:24:45.904000+00:00,Because it‚Äôs a very practical book you can use along side work

1698,2022-06-28T16:45:59.910000+00:00,but UAT is very typically done by the product manager or stakeholder
1699,2022-06-28T16:45:31.113000+00:00,"in some companies with EA programs, UAT can involve using EA's as end-users"
1700,2022-06-28T16:43:38.047000+00:00,"nor does it belong to the UX Designer, who does not write requirements"
1701,2022-06-28T16:43:22.801000+00:00,this is not a research activity

1708,2022-06-28T16:41:15.476000+00:00,UAT is might make no sense unless you're familiar with the systems V
1709,2022-06-28T14:49:33.604000+00:00,Not the responsibility of the UXR how well something is implemented
1710,2022-06-28T14:49:20.480000+00:00,Definitely done by devs and product owners etc
1711,2022-06-28T05:47:55.558000+00:00,"Yes, this is what read online too. However, as I am the sole ux designer on the team (early stage start up), I am being tasked to ensure UAT is being conducted properly so am trying to understand the process fully to implement it for our product cycle. Thanks for advice on mixing internal and external folks, will take note of that"
1712,2022-06-28T05:10:11.626000+00:00,"From my experience UAT is usually handled by a Business Analyst / Project Manager type role, since they're the ones who are in charge of making sure the product/service/website/whatever., meets all the requirements. It's very checklist-y. I'm not sure how many end users you typically need for UAT, but I would assume you want to have a good mix of internal/external folks to account for bias"
1713,2022-06-28T01:58:19.986000+00:00,"Hi, I am not too sure whether this is the right channel to ask. I have a question on UAT.  I am wondering who takes charge of UAT and usually UAT involves how many end users for testing? Is it alright just to conduct an Alpha testing internally? Thanks üôÇ"

- Research set up

1720,2022-06-23T06:09:01.833000+00:00,What we usually do is a more slide-deck style;
1721,2022-06-23T06:04:39.285000+00:00,Have you defined some clear research questions too?
1722,2022-06-23T06:00:12.650000+00:00,"I got information about the company, product & goals (this should probably shouldn't go into the report) then we went over user needs & goals, workshopped personas, and defined basic user tasks"
1723,2022-06-22T20:55:39.021000+00:00,I got some examples I could share in DM
1724,2022-06-22T20:55:22.460000+00:00,Could you give some more context of the type of discovery research?
1725,2022-06-22T19:04:08.191000+00:00,"I think it depends on what skills you want to showcase in your portfolio! So for example, if you really want to showcase your ability to do quality research, then that should be the focus, rather than app idea. Or if you want to showcase your ability to define a problem, then that should be your main focus (also in which case I would probably look for a different app idea since you've already found that there aren't many problems with current sleep apps). Or maybe you want to showcase your business ideation skills, in which case maybe the sleep app is good because you might have some innovative idea to create a low-cost pricing model!"
1726,2022-06-22T17:17:24.063000+00:00,Hellow uxers! I recently did a discovery workshop for a client and need to present a report with a summary and my findings. Any ideas/resources templates on how to structure and present this report?
1727,2022-06-21T21:53:37.604000+00:00,"Hello! I am looking to design a sleep app for a personal project/my portfolio. I did a competitor analysis of similar sleep apps (Calm, BetterSleep, Sleep Tracker) listing out all the pros/cons based on user reviews in the app store. It looks like most of the cons are related to affordability (people don't want to pay for premium subscription) and glitches/bugs, so there's not much I can do there from a UX design perspective. Though I have seen one complaint about lack of accessibility for blind people, which is something I could fix. My next step was to create a research survey on a google form to get a better idea of people's sleep needs/challenges, but I'm a bit stuck because I don't know how this would help me when the sleep apps that are currently out there are already pretty decent. So I guess my question is... how in-depth/unique/innovative do personal projects need to be?"
1728,2022-06-21T07:16:27.245000+00:00,Unless you need to buy one I suppose.
1729,2022-06-21T07:16:12.267000+00:00,"Like for example ""Do you have extra money"" setting up eye-tracker will not be much more expensive than usability testing. Nor will it be more useful if you don't know what you want to use it for."
1730,2022-06-21T07:14:49.841000+00:00,"I mean they do map certain methods, but certainly not with the reasoning behind it"
1731,2022-06-21T07:12:10.897000+00:00,"Bit shallow imo, definitely wouldn't follow"
1732,2022-06-21T01:50:04.083000+00:00,"user interviews is a big one. lots of people ask questions like, ""how many users should i actually interview?"" or ""what kinds of questions should i ask?"" again, all dependent on your project, the scope, and budget. executing an actual user interview varies so much from doing them for a school project versus work. these are all good to think about and go over with a product manager on your team"
1733,2022-06-21T01:48:18.559000+00:00,"also in a real-life work setting, you're bound to have constraints and limitations on what you can actually do, so if you really want to do diary studies for example, you might not get to. but that isn't to say you're not allowed to do any of these activities"
1734,2022-06-21T01:44:05.357000+00:00,"the main one i havent heard of/unsure of is card sorting. ive heard of diary studies, but have never explored it."
1735,2022-06-21T01:42:56.910000+00:00,"these are all potential activities you can do, mostly in the discovery stage of your UX project. i wouldn't follow this map concretely but since you mentioned you haven't heard of some of these activities, take the time to learn each one and how each activity can ensure in developing a great product"

1738,2022-06-18T01:23:56.863000+00:00,A really good starter resource is a book called just enough research
1739,2022-06-17T19:42:10.797000+00:00,So excited to start learning some UX Research! Anything I should know or good resources?
1740,2022-06-17T11:31:11.881000+00:00,Then you could construct several statements about the problem (which the storyboard assumes) and see for which % of people this is an actual problem (within your user base)
1741,2022-06-17T11:29:57.462000+00:00,"Really validating maybe a survey would work better. But this means you'll need to have access to recruit many people. In other words, pay recruitment panels."
1742,2022-06-17T11:28:06.351000+00:00,"However, this is a method of evaluation rather than validation"
1743,2022-06-17T11:26:53.378000+00:00,"In which you could interview people about their problems, in which you let them draw their own story boards and see how much they overlap and where they differ."
1744,2022-06-17T11:26:19.749000+00:00,"Yeah, for more creative methods there's also things like cultural probes"
1745,2022-06-17T08:29:52.261000+00:00,"Hmm, thank you so much. Really helps in giving perspective.<:BlobThanks:853500879167684628>"
1746,2022-06-17T07:19:10.637000+00:00,And just simple scenario testing. The story boards will be the 'scenarios' in that sense.
1747,2022-06-17T07:15:04.283000+00:00,Probably more like concept testing; for example: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hla1jzhan78&ab_channel=MScTE48

1753,2022-06-16T20:27:39.139000+00:00,Yea much usability testing needs to happen on this tail end of the project for this website. But I'm just wondering if there is an online resource or checklist for things to audit with regards to accessibility
1754,2022-06-16T20:27:33.796000+00:00,"Where they just go with a screen reader, or zoom funtionality"
1755,2022-06-16T20:27:23.822000+00:00,You sometimes see people doing accesibility audits though
1756,2022-06-16T20:26:27.474000+00:00,Yea I know you're supposed to design with accessibility in mind. I'm jumping on to a team in their final research phase and didn't have any hand in the design process. I was asked to go over the design and consult on things that needed improvement.
1757,2022-06-16T20:02:59.553000+00:00,Just because it‚Äôs accessible doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs usable though
1758,2022-06-16T20:02:42.339000+00:00,Usually already a big part of the responsibility there is for the designers or devs
1759,2022-06-16T20:02:10.387000+00:00,You don‚Äôt ‚Äòuser test‚Äô accessibility
1760,2022-06-16T20:01:01.465000+00:00,As in validating the ‚Äòproblem‚Äô the story board is visualizing is real?
1761,2022-06-16T20:00:41.747000+00:00,What exactly do you mean with validating the storyboard though?
1762,2022-06-16T20:00:22.457000+00:00,Card sorting probably isn‚Äôt the right method
1763,2022-06-16T19:10:06.654000+00:00,
1764,2022-06-16T19:09:05.187000+00:00,"there's a plugin for chrome called axe Devtools, there's a lot of paid features for automation testing, but if you want to just try it out, you can hover the elements manually and it'll show you it's accessibility"
1765,2022-06-16T18:59:36.753000+00:00,"Hi, does anyone have any resources on user testing a live website for accessibility considerations? Looking for a checklist or some way to determine if fonts are the right size, up to industry standards?"
1766,2022-06-16T14:48:49.057000+00:00,"Hi, so our designer came to us as he wants to validate his storyboard. I had thought of doing a card sorting but I am having trouble deciding how to do it , as in, this storyboard has a category title, image and then a broad description of the process. I am not able to decide which elements to include or exclude for the card sort. 
Also, he also wants to test a few concept sketches of the product that are an extension of what they had planned for the storyboard. 

I am feeling confused as I am not sure which methods would suit the best in this case! Any guidance will be really helpful!
p.s. - its an enterprise software."

1783,2022-06-08T15:53:29.290000+00:00,Otherwise what you‚Äôre describing now could just be achieved with a hyperlink

1866,2022-06-06T08:28:31.024000+00:00,Then it‚Äôs still good to have a ‚Äògoal‚Äô in mind
1867,2022-06-06T08:28:19.089000+00:00,i have no idea about this field so ...
1868,2022-06-06T08:27:53.118000+00:00,"Personally, i think they just want me to study about user behavior, how user do when they use mobile app, how they do when they search on desktop web"
1869,2022-06-06T08:26:16.645000+00:00,Can it only be behavioral or also attitudinal?
1870,2022-06-06T08:25:38.341000+00:00,More like prefference than behavior then thoughüëÄ
1871,2022-06-06T08:24:57.893000+00:00,Or what‚Äôs the behavior of people actually using discord for gaming rather than their ingame chat?
1872,2022-06-06T08:23:58.974000+00:00,Could be; what is the social behavior of MMORPG‚Äôs or what‚Äôs the behavior when people are exploring new games to buy?
1873,2022-06-06T08:22:47.064000+00:00,Maybe even something like game UX if that‚Äôs interesting and allowed
1874,2022-06-06T08:20:11.465000+00:00,"So it be good to see which kind of behaviors are interesting to you, also maybe even something close to your hobbies"
1875,2022-06-06T08:19:27.528000+00:00,Mindless scrolling behavior on social media
1876,2022-06-06T08:19:15.375000+00:00,"For example, buying behavior is different from chatting behavior"
1877,2022-06-06T08:18:47.519000+00:00,"Then I would try and brainstorms different kind of user goals first, and see which one is interesting to you"
1878,2022-06-06T08:18:04.468000+00:00,"Or is it more meta, research about researching user behavior on the web/app"
1879,2022-06-06T08:17:56.945000+00:00,Yes
1880,2022-06-06T08:16:49.974000+00:00,A so they basically said ‚Äòresearch user behavior on the web or app‚Äô?
1881,2022-06-06T08:15:51.101000+00:00,"It's not a design project, just a study of user behavior on app and website but there is no specific requirement, or app in the assignment, so im wondering if i should do the research based on a certain app/web or on all apps/webs in general?"
1882,2022-06-06T07:59:04.388000+00:00,"Step 1; what do you want to research?

Step 2; what method will be fit for that question?

Step 3; conduct the research 

Step 4; analyse the research 

Step 5; translate research into design decisions"
1883,2022-06-06T05:04:56.193000+00:00,"Hello everyone, I'm a graphic design student, I have no knowledge of UX but my school gave me an assignment to research on user behavior on apps and websites. I don't know where to start and how to do it step by step correctly, any help please."
1884,2022-06-05T22:13:27.901000+00:00,"OK I see, thank you so much for your helpüôè"
1885,2022-06-05T21:18:01.879000+00:00,Which is quite difficult; but yeah if it wasn‚Äôt it wouldn‚Äôt be worth the case
1886,2022-06-05T21:15:10.392000+00:00,As in with your survey that complexity would‚Äôve been fixing the issue of not finding enough people
1887,2022-06-05T21:13:10.092000+00:00,As in; what were the complexities of the research and how did you creatively solve that complexity in ways that wouldn‚Äôt be apparent to the reader?
1888,2022-06-05T20:52:45.563000+00:00,For example. But what do you want to tell about that interview? Why is a conversation between you and person interesting enough to be a case over any other conversation?
1889,2022-06-05T19:26:54.503000+00:00,so like interviews with people would be better
1890,2022-06-05T19:18:04.433000+00:00,"With surveys you aren‚Äôt going to showcase much, unless you are good with statistics and want to explain how you‚Äôve dealt with all the variables, sampling and calculated the significance"
1891,2022-06-05T19:17:26.251000+00:00,"Especially with some more ‚Äòcreative‚Äô methods. Such as card sorting, cultural probes, etc, in which you can easily show off a direct connection to the design."
1892,2022-06-05T19:16:08.264000+00:00,"You don‚Äôt want to ask people to do your surveys, you want people to talk with you directly."
1893,2022-06-05T19:13:58.295000+00:00,"Hey just wanted to ask a quick question, what is the best way to conduct UX research for portfolio case studies.

1905,2022-05-27T16:56:17.615000+00:00,"i'm at a company now where as UX designers, part of our responsibilities is to do UXR as part of the end-to-end process. we just hired our first UX researcher this week. in a different environment now, other than doing things like whiteboarding and user interviews, what i also consider as part of UXR - see if your company has an educational budget. you could take a course or attend a conference - jot down some notes and come back to your team w your learnings cause that'll serve as useful later down the line for backing up your user decisions. 

if you have a product manager, make sure you're constantly collaborating with them. the PMs i've met are very pro-user research and they should have the skillset to balance technical and business requirements with also, user requirements."
1906,2022-05-27T16:53:03.366000+00:00,"i was told any research counts as research - it doesn't have to be super duper fancy research like looking up academic or lab studies. even reading up on medium articles or following twitter thought leaders counts as research, as long as you're able to back up your findings w good evidence and data."
1907,2022-05-27T16:51:21.743000+00:00,"when i entered the UX industry, i came in the industry believing there is a strong need for UXR. my last company didn't take it seriously nor did they have the time or effort to invest in even the basics of UXR. if it helps, it was a startup and very early-stage startups rarely do UXR. it's now a non-negotiable for me when working in any UX team."
1908,2022-05-27T16:38:58.203000+00:00,that's tough. my company is about to hire a researcher for that reason - to show the results to support our design decisions
1909,2022-05-27T16:35:26.803000+00:00,I‚Äôm not a designer nor in a similar position thoughüëÄ
1910,2022-05-27T15:58:22.110000+00:00,"Though, then you have to ensure it's 'useful' and not blue sky research indeed."
1911,2022-05-27T15:57:52.539000+00:00,"Which may mean you're going to have to do research with very limited resources, and prove the business value that way."
1912,2022-05-27T15:55:04.662000+00:00,"Often seeing is believing. 

Like sometimes clients are like ""UX research? Pfffff, blue sky research."" But then if you just go do usability testing and show them the videos of the tests + value they bring they suddenly are much more easy to persuade."
1913,2022-05-27T15:41:07.505000+00:00,"I have been in UI and UX for a while now, but the huge majority of my time in the field has been with one software consultancy. I am curious if a near complete lack of research  (apart from client/stakeholder interviews and occasional visits to the sites where our software will be used) is the norm for most orgs like mine. We must rely on the research (if any) done by the client before bringing us on board.  It's just disheartening and frustrating to know we could and should be doing more, but won't.  (I guess this feels like a sub-post for living in the world in general these days, but man...)

How do designers in a similar position successfully push for research to be considered as part of the standard business practice?  How does one highlight the unknowns not covered by what a client brings to a project?"

1926,2022-05-24T20:07:04.084000+00:00,good thing for me I love games
1927,2022-05-24T20:06:03.598000+00:00,there are UX resources but the only ones I know of are for games lol
1928,2022-05-24T20:04:47.784000+00:00,I guess I am thinking of ux research like a normal subject in school like math and computer science where there are introduction to this topic
1929,2022-05-24T20:03:09.807000+00:00,"I dont think it needs to be super technical, it can be, it just depends on what youre researching and what questions youre trying to answer/gain insight into"
1930,2022-05-24T20:02:43.313000+00:00,yeah that's more or less how I think of it
1931,2022-05-24T20:02:28.586000+00:00,so its like conducting scientific research on user experience
1932,2022-05-24T20:01:51.368000+00:00,how to learn about ux research like the fundementals of ux research like books or online reasources
1933,2022-05-24T19:57:47.931000+00:00,"one thing I've seen come up a lot, and I do some of this, are surveys since you're making a direct inquiry about the user experience with a particular thing, games in my case"
1934,2022-05-24T19:56:34.279000+00:00,"user experience (ux) research is, as I understand it, a collection of things like data collection, analysis, and modeling about particular topics that affect users in games for example. what do users need/want/like/dislike and how can a product (like a game), service etc. be designed or changed to reflect the expressed or anticipated user needs"
1935,2022-05-24T19:52:23.081000+00:00,I don't even know what ux research is
1936,2022-05-24T07:35:36.384000+00:00,"Either through personal projects, or online collaborations"
1937,2022-05-24T07:30:56.572000+00:00,"By doing UX research basically and building up cases you can display those skills with,"
1938,2022-05-23T21:44:32.343000+00:00,"Hello everyone I was wondering how I can get into UX research, I have no experience in UX research I come from a cognitive science background looking to get into UX as a career path"
1939,2022-05-23T21:11:02.555000+00:00,Oh when you partner with the retailer! That's smart
1940,2022-05-23T21:01:29.589000+00:00,In brick store at least

1942,2022-05-23T20:55:58.662000+00:00,"Oh, yeah. Bigger recruiting hurdle there"
1943,2022-05-23T20:52:26.686000+00:00,E.g. doing a usability task while they also need to make sure their children don‚Äôt run away
1944,2022-05-23T20:51:46.881000+00:00,While with guerrilla testing people are in chaotic environments
1945,2022-05-23T20:48:44.545000+00:00,People are prepared and fully focused on the task
1946,2022-05-23T20:48:06.433000+00:00,Well basically most usability testing is like watching natural behavior of animals in a zoo
1947,2022-05-23T20:46:26.833000+00:00,That sounds juicy. What does it mean?
1948,2022-05-23T20:45:18.958000+00:00,Personally I think the biggest wins for the research are probably those outside controlled environments
1949,2022-05-23T20:41:41.907000+00:00,"Though most likely, tomorrow that will be less hours a week"
1950,2022-05-23T20:41:20.815000+00:00,Right now I got 24 research hours on the project per week

1955,2022-05-23T20:38:32.921000+00:00,I'm just trying to brainstorm more and more to do honestly
1956,2022-05-23T20:37:42.088000+00:00,Do you feel like something is missing from your efforts?
1957,2022-05-23T20:37:35.310000+00:00,"Oh yes, I've also doing card sort"
1958,2022-05-23T20:37:18.055000+00:00,Only the MVP is released so far
1959,2022-05-23T20:37:17.777000+00:00,I think I saw a reddit post that must have been from you about that epic card sort

1978,2022-05-19T06:40:39.194000+00:00,Then you get something ike this for example
1979,2022-05-19T06:38:15.471000+00:00,One method I found was simply site-search analytics to define trends in searching
1980,2022-05-19T06:10:35.980000+00:00,I think one fun test would be to give them real money to order a product
1981,2022-05-19T06:10:07.699000+00:00,I‚Äôve already done it that way. Though this time I really want to see what they do rather than say they do
1982,2022-05-19T02:04:10.779000+00:00,You can test that even with Figma if you run it that way
1983,2022-05-19T02:03:48.442000+00:00,I would do it more as a moderated interview and ask them what their thinking along the way
1984,2022-05-18T21:31:14.366000+00:00,Beside just doing it with a live app or very high fy proto

1992,2022-05-17T19:37:26.555000+00:00,I've seen Ideo do it and they just throw a whole paragraph in a plain post that links to a Google form screener haha. But I imagine there must be better ways
1993,2022-05-17T19:31:52.177000+00:00,Ahh I see! Well never attempted it honestly.
1994,2022-05-17T18:59:59.090000+00:00,"Yea I work for a market research firm and that's what we typically do, but this is a specific recruiting need that is more niche"
1995,2022-05-17T18:41:28.087000+00:00,Never attempted. Though in a recruitment panel you might pay 2 - 4 euro per response. That's going to be a lot cheaper than running a facebook ad (depending on the screening)
1996,2022-05-17T18:06:55.171000+00:00,"Like what increases response rate, any findings about what gets you better quality respondents, etc."
1997,2022-05-17T18:04:00.409000+00:00,Has anyone used IG/FB ads to recruit for studies? Curious if you've landed on any learnings around best practices
1998,2022-05-17T17:10:09.667000+00:00,Yes definitely! Unfortunately my company cannot afford me a tool in time for doing quantitative ü•≤ doing qualitative for now‚Ä¶
1999,2022-05-15T16:53:41.940000+00:00,"When analyzing a qualitative research results. What is the ""right"" way to do reverse scoring? I know that one set of the results need to be reversed, and than average them out. However, I wonder, how reliable that is? And would I need to do anything for things where someone have answered 5 in each direction (on a scale of 1-5)? Should I take the average of both positive and then the reversed negative scores and see how similar they are?"

2047,2022-05-09T14:12:26.972000+00:00,so what you're saying is ux research is on par with quantum science <:FrogCool:851335403864195083>
2048,2022-05-09T14:10:47.533000+00:00,how dare you all have research discussions over the weekend
2049,2022-05-08T22:45:16.128000+00:00,You could say when you‚Äôre diverging solutions that‚Äôs when you‚Äôre dividing and conquering difference is that not all of those converge/ are pursued
2050,2022-05-08T22:44:36.090000+00:00,But part of it if you think about it it just comes in UX in different phases
2051,2022-05-08T20:53:06.371000+00:00,makes sense
2052,2022-05-08T20:30:50.420000+00:00,It‚Äôs often useful if you‚Äôd want an AI to fix a problem
2053,2022-05-08T20:28:19.144000+00:00,But sadly most UX problems will always be a small light bulb in a stadium of darkness
2054,2022-05-08T20:27:18.902000+00:00,More for math or programming
2055,2022-05-08T20:27:00.113000+00:00,Which is why it wouldn‚Äôt work for a problem that‚Äôs not clearly definable
2056,2022-05-08T19:43:58.267000+00:00,"How efficiently will it work tho? I mean, as far as I think, when we try to divide a problem into small sub problems, there's always some things which get into the miscellaneous category i.e. we overlook that part, which can add a lot of material to our perspective towards the main problem."
2057,2022-05-08T19:31:59.797000+00:00,Probably rendering divide and conquer a bit useless
2058,2022-05-08T19:28:08.339000+00:00,So doesn‚Äôt work with regular problem strategy
2059,2022-05-08T19:27:56.490000+00:00,Design is a ‚Äòwicked‚Äô problem though

2061,2022-05-08T19:24:52.492000+00:00,Divide and conquer is a fun problem solving strategy too
2062,2022-05-08T15:42:47.878000+00:00,? Sure. I posted it more for anyone who likes exploring and contrasting these kinds of things than to make a point about one or another specific process (it's a big thread if you click thru)
2063,2022-05-08T14:23:09.745000+00:00,For Behavioral insights there‚Äôs something similar too
2064,2022-05-08T14:22:56.299000+00:00,"But yes most models follow the similar Define/plan, do something, analyze"
2065,2022-05-08T14:22:24.530000+00:00,I mean DMAIC and A3 are both lean six sigma so that‚Äôs a given

2089,2022-05-07T15:25:33.961000+00:00,I was thinking about that last week because I stumbled on this article about the increasingly porous barrier btwn academy and industry in CS https://interactions.acm.org/archive/view/november-december-2021/the-steep-cost-of-capture
2090,2022-05-07T15:22:42.998000+00:00,"Yeah I guess one attempts to solve a problem, the other one attempts to advance knowlegde for the sake of advancing knowledge"
2091,2022-05-07T15:20:34.723000+00:00,"I have a mean little idea about the pure/applied dichotomy, which is that pure research is just applied research with the practical purpose of advancing a field's canonical understandings"
2092,2022-05-07T15:20:34.163000+00:00,HCI isn't I suppose
2093,2022-05-07T15:20:15.081000+00:00,"Yeah, because it's to fuel design rather than make science statements"
2094,2022-05-07T15:19:00.993000+00:00,Because it has the intended result of practical application?
2095,2022-05-07T15:18:52.890000+00:00,Well I don't have a PhD so I may just be talking out of my *butt
2096,2022-05-07T15:18:11.531000+00:00,I guess that's why UXR is applied research too
2097,2022-05-07T15:18:05.729000+00:00,"That was very informative though, thank you for taking the time to clarify at length"
2098,2022-05-07T15:17:13.657000+00:00,Or go 500bc and say sophist
2099,2022-05-07T15:16:03.049000+00:00,We can get all 1800s on it and say wissenschaft or something
2100,2022-05-07T15:15:15.709000+00:00,I think psychology by itself wasn't considered a science maybe somewhere up to 1960 or so
2101,2022-05-07T15:14:10.412000+00:00,"Yeah, though then we can question whether it's a science at that point"
2102,2022-05-07T15:13:22.808000+00:00,At least until the psychologist starts to design therapeutic frameworks
2103,2022-05-07T15:11:44.528000+00:00,It will always be a simulation of the expected future state
2104,2022-05-07T15:11:33.640000+00:00,In UX it doesn't exist yet (if it's a new product or feature).
2105,2022-05-07T15:10:15.661000+00:00,"As in, any psychologist or sociologist researches a context which is in the now or past. The thing that is being researched exists. Same with quantum states, it exists, it doesn't have to be created."
2106,2022-05-07T15:08:46.137000+00:00,"Unless you're a ""no free will"" person, the result is indeterminate by our current ability"
2107,2022-05-07T15:07:46.163000+00:00,Ah I see what you mean
2108,2022-05-07T15:06:49.876000+00:00,"Yeah, but still a future state"
2109,2022-05-07T15:05:48.550000+00:00,ü§ü they're all your interpretations though
2110,2022-05-07T15:04:54.447000+00:00,You could think of it as designing into a gap defined by what's around it
2111,2022-05-07T15:04:37.492000+00:00,"Ultimately it's a question of locating a space into which a design fits though, no?"
2112,2022-05-07T15:04:20.087000+00:00,These aren't my own ideas by the way
2113,2022-05-07T15:03:35.047000+00:00,"Or well, sort of, in some situations"
2114,2022-05-07T15:03:13.731000+00:00,Which makes hypothesis not as great anymore
2115,2022-05-07T15:02:59.365000+00:00,And when it's live it might still fail
2116,2022-05-07T15:02:53.934000+00:00,In design we could do the most rigerous research for years
2117,2022-05-07T15:02:08.358000+00:00,A quantum law exist in the sense that we could create a quantum computer that will be right aslong the math was right.\
2118,2022-05-07T14:59:58.039000+00:00,"A design is still an idea, that does not yet exist in reality"
2119,2022-05-07T14:59:39.128000+00:00,"Yeah well, it's still a state that sort of 'exists' in that sense. Concretely defined with maths."
2120,2022-05-07T14:59:02.361000+00:00,Until you get into that terrifying quantum stuff <:ShockPickle:818734306905817118>
2121,2022-05-07T14:58:04.772000+00:00,Scientist always research an existing state; while design creates a non-existent state where you research a possible future
2122,2022-05-07T14:57:20.591000+00:00,I think this is what is interesting about a design solution vs a science too
2123,2022-05-07T14:56:23.217000+00:00,"So you get to ask ""what does this change"" instead of ""does this change this specific thing"" and maybe reap the benefits of serendipity"
2124,2022-05-07T14:55:47.052000+00:00,"That was my next follow-up, is there a hypothesis sitting with the designer that's a level removed from your research?"
2125,2022-05-07T14:54:50.246000+00:00,"Sort of, but in the end who's really designing that hypothesis? The researcher or the designer who imagines the solution?"
2126,2022-05-07T14:54:07.961000+00:00,"But in situations where you want to find out if a redesigned task flow reduces time to complete, you get more hypothesis-y?"
2127,2022-05-07T14:53:25.363000+00:00,"So in some situations, more exploratory ones, there's a vast difference then: ""What problems are people having?"" vs ""People are having this problem -- prove or disprove"""
2128,2022-05-07T14:53:01.554000+00:00,Bit like card sorting / tree testing
2129,2022-05-07T14:52:22.638000+00:00,Evaluation vs validation I suppose?
2130,2022-05-07T14:51:40.300000+00:00,"But if the question is about learning about certain mental maps, making statements will ensure you'll kill any chance of finding the unexpected"
2131,2022-05-07T14:50:11.228000+00:00,Which we can than A/B test
2132,2022-05-07T14:49:13.386000+00:00,Which is good in some situations like; if we apply the principle of scarcity to this product we will increase the sells
2133,2022-05-07T14:43:09.145000+00:00,Statement vs question
2134,2022-05-07T14:42:24.022000+00:00,"I suppose the research question has a more explorative incentive, the hypothesis more a solution or prediction"
2135,2022-05-07T14:41:13.110000+00:00,This is interesting btw -- what's the difference in practice between a research question and a hypothesis?
2136,2022-05-07T14:33:42.252000+00:00,"Yeah, convergen and divergent is central to almost any process"
2137,2022-05-07T14:13:28.514000+00:00,I have yet to find one that can't be turned into every other one with minimal reskinning
2138,2022-05-07T14:06:17.571000+00:00,Been taking a deep dive into UX methodologies and frameworks and I found out the double diamond and lean UX pairs well together
2139,2022-05-07T09:08:23.523000+00:00,"But unless your plan is to publish a paper, proving some kind of design principle; it probably isn‚Äôt of much added value"
2140,2022-05-07T09:01:12.971000+00:00,I don‚Äôt know if <@733042329140723792> or <@419168292041785345> do this
2141,2022-05-07T08:53:42.760000+00:00,As you then are trying to make a statement for the scientific community rather than just make a product more valuable or useable
2142,2022-05-07T08:52:58.458000+00:00,They‚Äôre more in a context for academic research
2143,2022-05-07T08:52:35.034000+00:00,The design itself is the hypothesis in some ways. You are not researching theories but products
2144,2022-05-07T08:52:28.574000+00:00,Maybe my fellow research peers are different but I barely do in depth hypothesis for UXR
2145,2022-05-06T22:12:48.095000+00:00,Do you want to explain maybe which parts you find generic or explain maybe specifically what parts of hypothesis making you‚Äôre hoping to learn? Feels like that way the others can recommend it easier
2146,2022-05-06T21:57:51.850000+00:00,and maybe I was a bit lazy indeed. But I did search on google a bit and found a many articles. There are a lot of very generic ones and I was hoping for some suggestion from more in depth material (like books) from people who read them already
2147,2022-05-06T21:55:50.901000+00:00,"oh yeah, sorry, it looks like a lazy question"
2148,2022-05-06T21:28:44.641000+00:00,I‚Äôd just google search for: hypothesis methodology
2149,2022-05-06T21:27:26.868000+00:00,That‚Äôs quite the meta question
2150,2022-05-06T17:27:07.489000+00:00,"Ahyo, cheers everyone!
I'm searching for some literature (books, papers...) on making research hypothesis. It's fine, or even better actually, if it's material from outside uxresearch, so if it comes from sociology or related fields. I'm trying to power up my research knowledge <:ayy:772350143705776130>"
2151,2022-05-05T17:05:12.758000+00:00,"And the truth is, we'll never be able to do anything without bias. But we can identify biases in the studies we run and try to mitigate it."
2152,2022-05-05T17:03:44.136000+00:00,The fact they were able to even install Lookback
2153,2022-05-05T17:03:40.791000+00:00,"üëè  inherently, we are systematically forced into a box of biases"
2154,2022-05-05T17:03:31.633000+00:00,Same with the remote culture
2155,2022-05-05T17:02:17.490000+00:00,Low digital fluency will not get to the screening surveys in the first place
2156,2022-05-05T17:01:53.180000+00:00,Which is one of the major drawbacks of recruitment agencies
2157,2022-05-05T17:00:52.461000+00:00,I guess then the premise is; if usability testing should we recruit mainly for a lower digital fluency?
2158,2022-05-05T16:55:16.398000+00:00,digital literacy imo is kinda yikes. Illiterate has a derogatory nature in regular speech so I really like what it was said before and call it digital fluency
2159,2022-05-05T16:50:11.707000+00:00,Which translates to ‚Äòdigital skills‚Äô I suppose
2160,2022-05-05T16:49:29.249000+00:00,In dutch it‚Äôs ‚Äúdigitale vaardigheden‚Äù
2161,2022-05-05T16:49:13.132000+00:00,What is?
2162,2022-05-05T16:45:08.540000+00:00,I've read it also as digital literacy but also that's a little outdated and very yikes imo
2163,2022-05-05T15:31:45.003000+00:00,Yeah same for writing I imagine
2164,2022-05-05T15:31:29.836000+00:00,Because in old tech when you press a button it always beeps
2165,2022-05-05T15:31:13.782000+00:00,I once read an article about a specific target group expecting technology to beep
2166,2022-05-05T15:31:11.188000+00:00,"In writing practices, the most simple writing usually does best across the board because even expert readers appreciate not having to spend the energy interpreting something"
2167,2022-05-05T15:30:20.237000+00:00,Though unsure if the same is true for seniors
2168,2022-05-05T15:30:04.003000+00:00,"If you focus on users who can‚Äôt see at all, low vision users will also be able to use it (not vice versa)"
2169,2022-05-05T15:29:23.051000+00:00,Yeah with accessibility it definitely makes sense
2170,2022-05-05T15:25:57.465000+00:00,"In the US I think we call this the ""curb cut effect"""
2171,2022-05-05T15:03:07.411000+00:00,also we say digital fluency than ability
2172,2022-05-05T15:02:33.779000+00:00,"It actually isn't flawed at all. 
That's the premise of inclusivity (and even accessibility). There's been more awareness and realization that designers are creating inherently biased products. There's a tendency to exclude people from different cultural and socio economic backgrounds."
2173,2022-05-05T14:30:41.134000+00:00,Which may be a little flawed I suppose...
2174,2022-05-05T14:30:33.290000+00:00,"As a way to focus on the outliers. Which assumes if the outliers are able to use it, everyone is able to use it."
2175,2022-05-05T14:29:49.400000+00:00,What do you think of doing mainly usability test with a focus on 'low digital ability' to get the most insights?
2176,2022-05-04T21:31:07.265000+00:00,Except tonight when I might dream about it
2177,2022-05-04T21:30:41.723000+00:00,"Don‚Äôt worry though, my ego is too big to be insulted"

2203,2022-05-04T20:45:29.960000+00:00,I'm going to guess you're in-house corporate?
2204,2022-05-04T20:41:44.125000+00:00,I guess that‚Äôs different in more senior roles
2205,2022-05-04T20:40:48.369000+00:00,I guess also because the research + hours is often already sold before I get it
2206,2022-05-04T20:40:12.025000+00:00,"Honestly I write a whole lot of planning + scripts, but rarely apart"
2207,2022-05-04T20:38:20.447000+00:00,Still exciting to ruffle everyones feathers tomorrow morning
2208,2022-05-04T20:36:51.842000+00:00,Or well the surgery is; but the news it‚Äôs required isn‚Äôt the best.
2209,2022-05-04T20:36:10.361000+00:00,While that is most definitely not in the interest of the patient
2210,2022-05-04T20:35:43.322000+00:00,Bit like a surgeon finally being able to do an exciting surgery
2211,2022-05-04T20:35:12.845000+00:00,While a lot of issues are much more exciting
2212,2022-05-04T20:34:57.965000+00:00,It feels like the cliff of the research budget

2250,2022-04-23T15:51:16.767000+00:00,Hi üëã what tools are u using for unmoderated card sorting?
2251,2022-04-22T07:38:13.588000+00:00,Which is based on Jeff Sauro
2252,2022-04-22T07:37:50.838000+00:00,Anyway this will be interesting: https://www.nngroup.com/articles/summary-quant-sample-sizes/
2253,2022-04-22T07:35:12.506000+00:00,However for amazon a 5% improvement is a few billions $$
2254,2022-04-22T07:34:26.203000+00:00,"Luckily usually a re-design is like a 200/300% improvement in early stages, so it doesn't always matter"
2255,2022-04-22T07:33:56.422000+00:00,"SO if the answer is a 10% improvement, and your sample is something like 30% error margin, it could as well be a 40% improvement, or 20% worse"
2256,2022-04-22T07:32:06.235000+00:00,"Because if something is a 10% improvement over another solution and your error margin isn't low enough, the improvement will not mean anything"
2257,2022-04-22T07:31:24.319000+00:00,"Especially in A/B testing, doing T-tests"
2258,2022-04-22T07:31:09.774000+00:00,And you do use statistical relevance in user tests in certain situations
2259,2022-04-22T07:28:11.675000+00:00,<@352038165009137664>
2260,2022-04-22T07:26:14.636000+00:00,"However, if you will ask task satisfaction (like rating difficulty) 50 people will be needed"
2261,2022-04-22T07:24:45.134000+00:00,"It will just be a higher margin of error so if you got a completion rate of 80%, it may be 70% / 90% next time you do the same test"
2262,2022-04-22T07:23:55.146000+00:00,"Though, probably can get insights with 25 as well"
2263,2022-04-22T07:22:50.997000+00:00,For a quant usertest testing something like task completion rate (which is binary) you only need about 40 people or so
2264,2022-04-22T07:21:35.464000+00:00,Mainly the metrics you want to use
2265,2022-04-22T07:21:12.432000+00:00,It will depend on many factors
2266,2022-04-22T06:39:42.124000+00:00,And if you have any other info on methodological practice and analysis for statistical user study...üòÅ
2267,2022-04-22T06:24:30.746000+00:00,"Hi!
Does anyone know where to find guidelines on how to determine statistical relevant sample size for user tests? 
I know that aiming to true  statistical relevance is not often the case for UX user tests. My doubt it's more for personal knowledge and to explain my colleagues why they shouldn't use ""statistical relevance"" when speaking of user tests.
Thanks üòå"
2268,2022-04-21T13:00:53.459000+00:00,anyone have a good user testing site to host usability testing for free (with audio recording)?
2269,2022-04-21T08:26:06.947000+00:00,"`Engaging a representative sample of participants in UX research sounds like a good idea but it is flawed. It requires lots of participants, does not work in an Agile development environment, stifles innovation and reduces your chances of finding problems in small sample usability tests. When combined with iterative design, theoretical sampling (where theory and data collection move hand in hand) provides a more practical alternative`"
2270,2022-04-21T08:25:56.589000+00:00,What do our UXR's think of this statement?
2271,2022-04-20T16:32:26.149000+00:00,If those salaries applied to the NL it would be even nicer
2272,2022-04-20T16:03:08.217000+00:00,Stole this from another server. Seems like you all in UXR had a pretty good year! https://www.userinterviews.com/state-of-user-research-2022-report
2273,2022-04-20T13:59:47.729000+00:00,please move your post to <#943196929813282857>.
2274,2022-04-20T08:51:09.372000+00:00,<#943196929813282857>
2275,2022-04-20T08:50:55.955000+00:00,on the right it looks like a button to me
2276,2022-04-20T07:55:04.100000+00:00,which one is a better layout?
2277,2022-04-20T00:23:02.780000+00:00,"Hi, Idk if this is the right place to ask but does anyone have a examples of good ux researcher portfolios to share?"
2278,2022-04-19T15:05:25.246000+00:00,So they're the ones I need to persuade
2279,2022-04-19T14:56:19.704000+00:00,It's the standard native IoS dev set icon for top navs
2280,2022-04-19T12:06:49.187000+00:00,"Then it will be in their hands whether they'll change it, want to test it more, or keep it the way it is"
2281,2022-04-19T12:05:21.772000+00:00,Though I will actually present it to the client PO and UX lead in 30 mins
2282,2022-04-19T12:05:09.634000+00:00,Of course
2283,2022-04-19T12:03:40.060000+00:00,"In the data sets I can see who got IoS and who doesn't, so can filter to see if it got an influence"
2284,2022-04-19T12:03:14.484000+00:00,Now I do have the results though
2285,2022-04-19T12:03:08.395000+00:00,"If I do have an idea before the results yeah, but that would've mainly been an assumption."
2286,2022-04-19T12:00:43.269000+00:00,As a UXR it‚Äôs good to provide the feedback if you have a good idea of the results even before testing imo
2287,2022-04-19T11:59:41.081000+00:00,So that documentation is specifically for the tap bar only
2288,2022-04-19T11:59:22.098000+00:00,"Not my decision, I just test it"
2289,2022-04-19T11:59:21.651000+00:00,That says ‚Äútab bar‚Äù
2290,2022-04-19T11:59:17.063000+00:00,But again <@!209640428151111680> check that documentation
2291,2022-04-19T11:58:52.503000+00:00,I wouldn‚Äôt have even used to circle myself to begin with tbh
2292,2022-04-19T11:58:43.083000+00:00,Then the sign is clear don‚Äôt use the circle
2293,2022-04-19T11:58:28.966000+00:00,I mean if your participant selection criteria cover both android and IOS users and still ppl found ‚Äú‚Ä¶‚Äù more relatable
2294,2022-04-19T11:58:25.990000+00:00,I will go catch him in his tracks now
2295,2022-04-19T11:58:14.385000+00:00,Well seems like the designer has been lying then<:FrogHmm:814195819061575742>
2296,2022-04-19T11:57:48.752000+00:00,It could be reserved towards apple in house dev apps or just old haven‚Äôt changed
2297,2022-04-19T11:55:20.890000+00:00,Maybe earlier IoS versions used it?
2298,2022-04-19T11:53:21.308000+00:00,Mhh according to their icons at Human Interface it's without a circle I see indeed
2299,2022-04-19T11:46:12.299000+00:00,The same often happens with the share icon Android/APple
2300,2022-04-19T11:45:51.389000+00:00,"Yeah, I suppose it's still worth testing with apple users specificall"
2301,2022-04-19T11:45:13.191000+00:00,Also image gal
2302,2022-04-19T11:44:56.751000+00:00,So far I only see it in notes and reminders
2303,2022-04-19T11:44:08.344000+00:00,
2304,2022-04-19T11:44:08.151000+00:00,numbers
2305,2022-04-19T11:43:58.539000+00:00,Most of the time it‚Äôs really just ‚Ä¶
2306,2022-04-19T11:43:34.019000+00:00,That‚Äôs maybe the only instance tbh
2307,2022-04-19T11:43:07.533000+00:00,you can see it being used in the native apple apps
2308,2022-04-19T11:42:58.134000+00:00,
2309,2022-04-19T11:42:21.136000+00:00,So that begs the question how well Apple users actually recognise that symbol
2310,2022-04-19T11:41:47.160000+00:00,Android uses without a circle
2311,2022-04-19T11:41:39.543000+00:00,Is the IoS icon
2312,2022-04-19T11:41:35.946000+00:00,
2313,2022-04-19T11:41:22.302000+00:00,I may have found out why
2314,2022-04-19T06:24:36.827000+00:00,"You can always just ask your questions here as well, when you have them. Many people willing to answer"
2315,2022-04-19T05:56:26.989000+00:00,"Hello everyone, I‚Äôm struggling with my UX research, anyone open to mentoring me. I‚Äôm teachable and willing to learn. 

Thank you so much"
2316,2022-04-17T06:50:52.976000+00:00,Just not clear why
2317,2022-04-17T06:50:41.542000+00:00,"Yes, it‚Äôs quite clear that it isn‚Äôt. People don‚Äôt click it in task that they should."
2318,2022-04-17T00:18:24.650000+00:00,But did you have any suspicions or signs it wasn‚Äôt working?
2319,2022-04-16T22:14:13.630000+00:00,As it impacts how well people can manage their whishlists
2320,2022-04-16T22:13:44.269000+00:00,"Yeah, at the level of detail the product is currently tested this icon is definitely big impact"
2321,2022-04-16T19:06:17.602000+00:00,Wouldn‚Äôt test every little thing
2322,2022-04-16T19:06:11.354000+00:00,I would just think about impact vs effort
2323,2022-04-16T18:53:56.871000+00:00,Though of course still up to them whether it‚Äôs worth the money to do so
2324,2022-04-16T18:53:05.745000+00:00,"Yeah well they is me, I can decide the research direction<:FrogCool:802104190079729714> (in collaboration with the UX lead)"
2325,2022-04-16T18:06:59.634000+00:00,Besides maybe a designer feeling like B was a good idea
2326,2022-04-16T18:06:49.372000+00:00,I mean is there a reason they had to AB test this
2327,2022-04-16T17:25:43.342000+00:00,Just need to statistically prove it
2328,2022-04-16T17:25:19.749000+00:00,"Well the app I‚Äôm testing does, but people obviously don‚Äôt seem to have an idea what it is<:megalaugh:760301205082603573>"
2329,2022-04-16T17:23:44.791000+00:00,Haha yeah I don‚Äôt think people use the one with the circle around it at all
2330,2022-04-16T14:57:47.147000+00:00,The one with the circel around it is less recognizable
2331,2022-04-16T14:57:17.637000+00:00,
2332,2022-04-16T14:56:45.736000+00:00,
2333,2022-04-16T14:56:44.401000+00:00,So far it seems that
2334,2022-04-16T14:56:14.083000+00:00,"This week I'll be A/B testing two icons, to see which one works better as a menu icon"
2335,2022-04-16T14:50:34.603000+00:00,"It's also only a sample of 30, so can just be chance"
2336,2022-04-16T14:46:20.891000+00:00,Need to see how I can get the line in R
2337,2022-04-16T14:46:13.880000+00:00,"Yeah, maybe not"
2338,2022-04-16T14:46:04.266000+00:00,Idk if we can fully call that bi modal
2339,2022-04-16T14:45:55.645000+00:00,Playing around with R
2340,2022-04-16T14:45:46.114000+00:00,

I like to see data from around 30 days - 3 months to see recent trends. I also like taking the screenshots of the various heatmaps and insert them into FigJam to see them at a glance and make any comments with my team. 

When we watch recordings we'll usually apply filters if we want to look at a specific page or event. We'll watch them at 2-4x speed to make the process a little quicker and use HotJar's commenting system to take notes of any initial trends we see. 

We also use figjam to organize our notes about the data we collect and it's worked out for us!"

2359,2022-04-08T05:20:16.535000+00:00,"So by itself definitely doesn‚Äôt always say much, but can definitely point out where to focus your attention"
2360,2022-04-08T05:18:59.256000+00:00,Some had 0% missclicks and probably just took their time
2361,2022-04-08T05:18:19.143000+00:00,Some definitely had problems in usability
2362,2022-04-08T05:17:04.174000+00:00,"By then analysing the screens and click paths of those users specifically, some just set the test to finish without doing anything"
2363,2022-04-08T05:15:44.146000+00:00,But there were also some who had 30 sec and a chunk between 90 and 120 sec
2364,2022-04-08T05:14:50.126000+00:00,Like in my last test most people had between 40 and 80 sec task time
2365,2022-04-08T05:07:57.751000+00:00,So you can delete them if they‚Äôre cheaters
2366,2022-04-08T05:07:28.010000+00:00,Also to identify outliers in big data sets
2367,2022-04-08T05:07:09.838000+00:00,It‚Äôs easy in quant studies
2368,2022-04-08T05:00:04.823000+00:00,I do yes
2369,2022-04-08T04:50:49.246000+00:00,Does anyone have experience conducting usability tests on ecommerce sites?
2370,2022-04-07T21:28:24.964000+00:00,That makes sense!
2371,2022-04-07T21:13:30.132000+00:00,Not sure if people measure it live
2372,2022-04-07T21:13:03.879000+00:00,Because then you can control the ‚Äòtask‚Äô
2373,2022-04-07T21:12:37.444000+00:00,Yeah basically it‚Äôs more a metric in the sense of a task in a testscript
2374,2022-04-07T19:42:47.589000+00:00,Even if you measure retention unless it‚Äôs specific to the page itself aka bounce rate it‚Äôs hard to link the reason for leaving directly due to that page being quicker
2375,2022-04-07T19:39:33.142000+00:00,"Ah, wasn't aware it was just a prototype"
2376,2022-04-07T19:35:43.690000+00:00,Can‚Äôt really test that in a prototype
2377,2022-04-07T16:47:53.286000+00:00,"Would you also want to consider something like retention here (assuming it's relevant to your product)? Like if people are completing a task flow and then disappearing, maybe they treat it as a sunk cost in the moment but resolve to never use your service again"
2378,2022-04-07T16:39:59.650000+00:00,"a shorter task time might also come with a higher error rate, or less comprehension"
2379,2022-04-07T16:39:38.282000+00:00,"but in a practical reality, time is such a subjective thing. you can make a task feel longer or shorter to a person depending on how it is presented, or what the interaction is."
2380,2022-04-07T16:37:47.382000+00:00,"look we're doing better, our time to task is shorter and so the UI is easier to use!"
2381,2022-04-07T16:37:33.443000+00:00,"I think a lot of UX people measure it, because it's very easy to quantify performance with it. Lower = Better"
2382,2022-04-07T16:37:03.362000+00:00,task time** is such a weird metric. its like one part of a story
2383,2022-04-07T07:55:50.016000+00:00,And: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keystroke-level_model
2384,2022-04-07T07:53:08.997000+00:00,"```
How long should a task take? There are several strategies for identifying an acceptable task time.
1: Find task times for competing products or products with acclaimed user interfaces.

2:Find the time for the prior version or similar version of the product.

3:Find the times from the most satisfied users. I call this a bootstrapped specification limit[pdf].

4: Carrying out the task without use of a computer system (or on an older platform e.g., in DOS)

5: Identifying the expert or fastest task time and setting the unacceptable condition to 1.5 times (or another multiple) this time for each task. You can use the results from a KLM analysis. Note: It‚Äôs unclear what a good multiple should be. More research is needed to make this approach more meaningful so use it as a last resort.

https://measuringu.com/real-task-time/"
2387,2022-04-07T07:52:10.099000+00:00,Found an interesting article about task times though:
2388,2022-04-07T07:51:32.586000+00:00,"Yeah, well I guess I'll just put the question in here when it arrises then!"
2389,2022-04-06T23:22:24.387000+00:00,"Alas, I'd have to also reread that book you got these days üòÑ"
2390,2022-04-06T23:22:16.410000+00:00,If you asked me a few years ago when that information was more fresh in my head I could
2391,2022-04-05T22:31:32.337000+00:00,Let me know if you'd like a study buddy
2392,2022-04-05T22:30:41.709000+00:00,Looks very interesting!!
2393,2022-04-05T05:07:48.593000+00:00,"Yeah, just seeing in advance, who I can ask for stat related questions üòÅ"
2394,2022-04-05T00:50:23.573000+00:00,Did you get your thing figured out <@!209640428151111680>
2395,2022-04-04T16:32:00.928000+00:00,I have a basic understanding form process control I just need to check some stuff for which test to run cause I don‚Äôt have those memorized what‚Äôs up
2396,2022-04-04T13:43:31.958000+00:00,As I kind of need to prove this with a t-test haha
2397,2022-04-04T13:43:13.124000+00:00,Was actually a response to this reply
2398,2022-04-04T13:42:43.080000+00:00,How well is your statistics knowledge? Things like T-tests etc?
2399,2022-04-04T01:50:01.472000+00:00,This is very true esp if their time is compensated
2400,2022-04-03T21:57:35.914000+00:00,"Things like maze will automatically calculate thatbfor you, based on missclicks"
2401,2022-04-03T21:31:42.189000+00:00,It‚Äôs not a binary metric
2402,2022-04-03T21:28:05.592000+00:00,Meaning people will put in more effort than normally
2403,2022-04-03T21:27:37.333000+00:00,Especially since usability test are still lab studies
2404,2022-04-03T21:26:00.360000+00:00,So there are still ‚Äòlevels‚Äô of success
2405,2022-04-03T21:25:30.564000+00:00,"Often happens during usability test, is that people keep searching because you are there watching them"
2406,2022-04-03T21:20:48.245000+00:00,"Like navigating wrong, but going back and still finding it vs not finding it at all"
2407,2022-04-03T21:20:21.780000+00:00,You got direct and indirect success
2408,2022-04-03T21:20:08.506000+00:00,The article implies misclicks
2409,2022-04-03T17:39:26.563000+00:00,Like I wouldn‚Äôt do ‚Äúthis was a 80% success‚Äù unless you had actually 10 tasks and 8 tasks were completed successfully
2410,2022-04-03T17:38:48.141000+00:00,1/2 fail still kinda counts as a fail and you can break it out if you want
2411,2022-04-03T17:38:17.961000+00:00,I mean you break it down by task and the task is either success or a fail
2412,2022-04-03T16:35:13.998000+00:00,That's what Dario's article seemed to imply with major and minor issues distinguishing categories
2413,2022-04-03T16:34:58.240000+00:00,"Ah yeah, okay - for task completion rate we set our own levels of failure/success right, it isn't determined by a more holistic stat like time unless we determine it to be?"
2414,2022-04-03T16:33:19.813000+00:00,It‚Äôs not like you‚Äôre trying to shorten time and need to prove the after is statistically different
2415,2022-04-03T16:32:54.761000+00:00,Even then task completion still makes more sense cause the time doesn‚Äôt have anything for you to compare to
2416,2022-04-03T16:31:35.282000+00:00,ahh ok gotcha - that makes more sense!
2417,2022-04-03T16:29:59.190000+00:00,It‚Äôs just one test but whether or not your recording
2418,2022-04-03T16:26:06.448000+00:00,I'll read up on the stuff yall sent thanks guys
2419,2022-04-03T16:25:49.583000+00:00,I don't think we have the time to run two usability tests
2420,2022-04-03T16:25:33.494000+00:00,"Hmm, we're not modifying existing features we're building on top of the app with new items"
2421,2022-04-03T15:41:29.590000+00:00,Imo time is for optimizing and identifying issues in the beginning if he already changed stuff the task completion rate makes more sense
2422,2022-04-03T08:35:18.325000+00:00,If your study is quant at least
2423,2022-04-03T08:34:49.070000+00:00,Should probably measure both
2424,2022-04-03T08:18:52.964000+00:00,https://www.nngroup.com/articles/success-rate-the-simplest-usability-metric
2425,2022-04-03T08:16:50.628000+00:00,Completion rate is often put together with miss click rate. So you get a success rate on different levels.
2426,2022-04-03T08:15:53.042000+00:00,There happens to be a discussion about this on <#733146730731798598> yesterday
2427,2022-04-03T05:47:38.053000+00:00,"For example, I'm adding several new features onto a pre-existing app - I wanted to conduct a usability study to see how easy it is for new and old users of the app alike to navigate through the app and ""understand"" the value of the new features being added. Because the new features don't have to do with task based work, I wasn't sure if measuring time to completion was a good idea - maybe just task completion rate?"
2428,2022-04-03T05:46:32.951000+00:00,"For time on task vs task completion rate, are they both utilized pretty similarly together or do they have different use cases?"
2429,2022-04-03T02:27:08.953000+00:00,Thank you <@!589247034410926088> !
2430,2022-04-02T21:52:23.195000+00:00,If you ask ppl how likely they would use a feature they often overestimate how likely they would
2431,2022-04-02T21:51:59.009000+00:00,Also to add on to what Dario said Surveys can be biased
2432,2022-04-02T14:41:10.515000+00:00,Thank you <@!209640428151111680>  ! This was really helpful
2433,2022-04-02T12:19:44.059000+00:00,"So long story short. Probably don't do surveys, unless your target demographic is very active on the medium you're sharing it on. Because it's pretty likely, if you were to do the exact same survey, the answers will just be completely different again."
2434,2022-04-02T12:05:23.305000+00:00,"If 1/10th of this discord would fall into that category, that means you'd need 4000 people."
2435,2022-04-02T12:04:48.629000+00:00,"But since you have no control of who answers, you'd need to calculate the chance of people responding that fall into your 'demographic'."
2436,2022-04-02T12:03:41.923000+00:00,"So more like 400 replies, rather than 40. Given you control all the characteristics of 'who' answers and who doesn't."
2437,2022-04-02T11:35:35.384000+00:00,"But if you ask more attitudinal things, this answer will very quickly shoot up."
2438,2022-04-02T11:34:52.519000+00:00,"Also the nature of the questions. For a quantitative usability test, like a click test, 40 would definitely be enough."
2439,2022-04-02T11:33:48.772000+00:00,"Most likely, 4 interviews will already give you much more insights than those 40 surveys."
2440,2022-04-02T11:31:39.602000+00:00,"That depends on a few things.

1: How representative you want the answers to be of your 'users'.

2: What the characteristics are that influence this representativity.  

3: How big this group of users is."
2441,2022-04-02T07:53:39.941000+00:00,"What would be a good number of participants to fill out a survey for UX design projects? Right now, I managed to get 40 people for one of my surveys, but I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôll reach that mark for my other surveys."
2442,2022-03-30T08:41:52.902000+00:00,The N is 50

2463,2022-03-25T11:52:28.683000+00:00,"Fun example of dating apps competitive research, to give some idea of metrics"
2464,2022-03-25T10:51:34.084000+00:00,"Hello everyone, is there's an app/tool for inspection and observation that can create report, take photo/video and add a description to it etc ..."
2465,2022-03-25T06:49:49.509000+00:00,An extra possible step is first doing desk research; chat functionality isn‚Äôt new. There‚Äôs probably tons of problems already defined (Cyber bullies for example)
2466,2022-03-25T06:48:54.440000+00:00,"So if you want do analysis to these apps 

1: define the context and goal of use

2: define metrics fit for the scope of use / scope of functionality 

3: choose competitors based on the previous metrics. A few direct competitors, indirect and niche use. Like what‚Äôs the difference between a Guild in a game and a group chat in a chat app? (Maybe that‚Äôs why discord got roles)

4: screenshot the specific user flow and put it on a white board or digital whiteboard and simply objectively state the observation"
2467,2022-03-25T06:32:44.517000+00:00,All who involved different metrics and apps
2468,2022-03-25T06:32:12.872000+00:00,"One analysis was just about wishlists, another just about delivery information, another just about onboardings, another just about product configuration"
2469,2022-03-25T06:30:07.757000+00:00,I‚Äôve been doing many competitive analysis for e-commerce lately
2470,2022-03-25T06:28:26.824000+00:00,Also it‚Äôs ok to look at 1 single feature.
2471,2022-03-25T06:27:19.818000+00:00,"So then they can say; these 10 things are great, so we‚Äôre going to steal them. These 10 things are not as good, so we must avoid them or solve them."
2472,2022-03-25T06:26:13.255000+00:00,Apps like Slack did competitive research to look at WhatsApp through the lens of usage in a business environment.
2473,2022-03-25T06:23:56.122000+00:00,Then you‚Äôre only looking at direct competitors. Discord is also a chat app. Even World of Warcraft is fit for analysis if ‚Äòsocial interaction ‚Äô is the metric.
2474,2022-03-25T06:22:45.834000+00:00,Then there‚Äôs also; you don‚Äôt want to compare an entire app. You want to compare specific features used for specific goals.
2475,2022-03-25T06:21:38.875000+00:00,So then it already become ‚Äòfor who is it the best‚Äô rather than ‚Äòwho is the best‚Äô
2476,2022-03-25T06:20:43.999000+00:00,"Then the other issue is you don‚Äôt seemed to have defined the scope of measurement. WhatsApp used in which user case? Two lovers trying to connect, a business having a business chat, a book club sharing books?"
2477,2022-03-25T06:17:21.279000+00:00,"There‚Äôs a few issues here.

Competitive research is not about who‚Äôs the best or worst. It‚Äôs called that because they are ‚Äòcompetitors‚Äô but in essence competitive research is comparative research. Who has the edge should‚Äôt be the concern. Even if you were to say ‚Äòtelegram is the best‚Äô, and they say ‚Äòthen why is whatsapp making more money and got better store reviews?‚Äô What will you answer?"
2478,2022-03-25T02:55:43.260000+00:00,I had similar issue with mine --- until i stated looking at the overall product reviews. I was able to find some issues even in my best competitor.
2479,2022-03-25T00:28:05.717000+00:00,If your audit only concerns features though it's probably fine to report that nobody seems to have an edge there. That's the truth
2480,2022-03-25T00:24:38.099000+00:00,"If we don't figure out why *users* prefer those services, we can't figure out what to do with the product"
2481,2022-03-25T00:21:52.081000+00:00,"In America, WhatsApp also competes with iMessage and plain old text messaging"
2482,2022-03-25T00:21:23.629000+00:00,"There's one key feature of the competitors you identified, which is regional adoption (you can include Kakao as another regional chat app hegemon)"
2483,2022-03-25T00:18:43.058000+00:00,"By looking at different apps, it seemed like Whataspp is on top of their games. I guess what my concern or question is that.. what do you do when you can‚Äôt find anything greater than your current product?
I guess let‚Äôs say, if your competitor‚Äôs product are pretty equal to your product, then does that mean that it‚Äôs time to enhance the current features to a better version or is it a perfect time to add a new feature?"
2484,2022-03-25T00:12:29.837000+00:00,Can you go into a little more detail regarding how you're arriving at these overall conclusions?
2485,2022-03-25T00:06:15.213000+00:00,"Hi guys! I have a question about competitive analysis. So, I'm currently researching other direct competitors from Whatsapp and it seems like none of the apps are better than whatsapp (telegram, line, wechat, etc). When this happens, what can I conclude about the competitive analysis? I know I have analyzed about each app's strengths and weaknesses but there's nothing standing out that I could take from. Also, since whatsapp is a popular product, does it mean that adding a new feature is much likely to succeed than other competing apps? Would love to hear you guys insights or any thoughts about this. Thanks üôÇ"

2507,2022-03-22T17:15:15.755000+00:00,Many colleagues have already used it though
2508,2022-03-22T17:15:06.015000+00:00,It will be very likely I will be doing UH yeah
2509,2022-03-22T17:14:23.790000+00:00,I have many questions <:FrogHmm:879768611240149052>
2510,2022-03-22T17:14:16.053000+00:00,let me know if you decide to go with UH! <@!209640428151111680>
2511,2022-03-22T16:33:55.552000+00:00,My bad lmao
2512,2022-03-22T16:33:39.724000+00:00,"Never made the association myself, but yeah, now you mention I definitely can‚Äôt unsee it"
2513,2022-03-22T16:32:50.102000+00:00,Apparently people don‚Äôt mind being lab rats for 1 dollar
2514,2022-03-22T16:31:13.740000+00:00,Maze is interesting. I'm surprised they went with that name for it. I would've expected people to be turned off by the pretty close association to lab rats
2515,2022-03-22T16:27:23.428000+00:00,"But that‚Äôs too high tech for maze apparently, being one big blackbox"
2516,2022-03-22T16:27:00.626000+00:00,"The idea was to do a screener through Alchemer, then re-direct to maze"
2517,2022-03-22T16:26:12.245000+00:00,Thus then recruiting agencies don‚Äôt know who to pay and who not üí∞
2518,2022-03-22T16:25:44.666000+00:00,But apparently  maze doesn‚Äôt offer completion rates etc
2519,2022-03-22T16:24:59.761000+00:00,I was planning to use maze and an external recruitment for the link
2520,2022-03-22T16:24:17.357000+00:00,It‚Äôs new!
2521,2022-03-22T15:47:46.573000+00:00,<:FrogHmm:879768611240149052> I didn't know they even had prototype testing on usabilityhub!
2522,2022-03-22T15:40:32.715000+00:00,"I was planning a Maze test, but Maze doesn't have a Dutch panel, UsabilityHub does"
2523,2022-03-22T15:39:04.575000+00:00,Does anyone have experience with the new Figma function of https://usabilityhub.com/ ?
2524,2022-03-22T12:03:18.563000+00:00,"Thanks for all the feedback, I have adjusted and narrowed the scope and research to only UI/UX related items."
2525,2022-03-21T18:28:39.656000+00:00,"Also this part `Yep, a lot of the data was already available -- so I conducted the survey only to validate a few assumptions and value proposition of the product.`"
2526,2022-03-21T18:27:15.601000+00:00,The main thing was she confused market and UXR a bit I suppose
2527,2022-03-21T18:24:18.779000+00:00,I just enjoy arguing Prototype
2528,2022-03-21T18:23:50.644000+00:00,"so idk, why i'm arguing with you üòõ"
2529,2022-03-21T18:23:44.794000+00:00,lol
2530,2022-03-21T18:23:44.106000+00:00,I think we're both saying the same thing though
2531,2022-03-21T18:23:15.600000+00:00,vs. taking a survey of just random times of the day
2532,2022-03-21T18:23:06.166000+00:00,and extrapolate behavior patterns
2533,2022-03-21T18:22:58.676000+00:00,"I would rather know ""why"" someone blogs at a certain time of the day"
2534,2022-03-21T18:22:44.808000+00:00,this seems like the kind of information I would not rely on quant for
2535,2022-03-21T18:22:31.967000+00:00,"> Just some specific patterns in user behavior, say for eg: what time of the day are people more likely to use a blogging app?"
2536,2022-03-21T18:22:29.441000+00:00,I just went back and reread
2537,2022-03-21T18:16:11.049000+00:00,Unless you got some text mining abilities
2538,2022-03-21T18:15:22.794000+00:00,It would be like choosing to design the UI with MS Paint
2539,2022-03-21T18:09:45.656000+00:00,Doing a survey for open questioning like that wouldn't be right
2540,2022-03-21T18:06:54.270000+00:00,"She was doing survey for tech use, so those are quant I suppose. More market oriented research."
2541,2022-03-21T18:02:51.540000+00:00,parsing through responses from 30 people would be crazy
2542,2022-03-21T18:02:42.399000+00:00,"if they're beginning with a survey, the data they're gathering is probably qualitative"
2543,2022-03-21T18:01:49.067000+00:00,
2544,2022-03-21T18:01:47.474000+00:00,There's also this graph
2545,2022-03-21T17:50:14.749000+00:00,Depending on the research I suppose
2546,2022-03-21T17:50:05.040000+00:00,We usually recruit 500 per country
2547,2022-03-21T15:43:01.739000+00:00,"30 respondents to a survey is actually quite a bit. Whenever a project starts with a survey, I always question what the purpose of the survey was."
2548,2022-03-21T15:41:59.019000+00:00,"All of the steps are technically non-essential, your research needs to align to your goals."
2549,2022-03-21T13:27:16.850000+00:00,"Alright, good luck! üëå"
2550,2022-03-21T13:14:27.131000+00:00,I think the confusion regarding market vs UX research has happened because I followed the Google UX course. The way the content is laid out for UX research has a lot in common with market research. I'm pretty sure I ended up followed the same pattern subconsciously.
2551,2022-03-21T13:12:56.676000+00:00,"Thank you for the amazing resources. I think in the case of the e-commerce app ( for which research is completed ) --- I got the unique features covered, and user motivations to buy online as well ( fun fact - time of day plays a role here as well ). But I guess I do need to study the overall structure of the app and usability functionalities a little more."
2552,2022-03-21T13:01:19.127000+00:00,"So for example, you could download 5 of the top blog apps. 

Pick metrics of things you want to compare that can easily be translated to design.

- What are the unique Features?
- How are users motivated to read?
    - Desk research to motivation in reading
- General article structure

etc etc"
2553,2022-03-21T12:56:51.239000+00:00,"Take different metrics to compare competitors, such as the functionalities the blog apps use, etc."
2554,2022-03-21T12:56:06.457000+00:00,"But even with competitive research, don't try and focus on your common competitive market research. Markets probably won't tell you a lot. Unless you're following a marketing course."
2555,2022-03-21T12:55:14.307000+00:00,"To give some sources. But again, keep note of the difference in experience and market research. Even the value proposition can be seen from multiple perspectives:

2556,2022-03-21T12:52:48.977000+00:00,"No, where can I find it?"
2557,2022-03-21T12:52:29.355000+00:00,Have you looked at Jobs To Be Done research methods?
2558,2022-03-21T12:51:58.683000+00:00,"You can do both, but they're separate stages."
2559,2022-03-21T12:51:06.086000+00:00,"That's something I had not considered -- I guess I'll have to shift focus and narrow the scope to usability and UI related issues --- though defining a value proposition becomes a little difficult in this case. While the blog project is kicking off now, one of my other projects is e-commerce/online ordering with a similar design prompt. That one will definitely need some scope changes"
2560,2022-03-21T12:50:36.797000+00:00,Being the designer doesn't mean 100% of the product is your responsibility
2561,2022-03-21T12:49:26.806000+00:00,The kind of role you want to meet at a company.
2562,2022-03-21T12:49:14.378000+00:00,So how you do this product also depends on what kind of designer you wish to be.
2563,2022-03-21T12:48:24.727000+00:00,"Of course it's important, but they're different responsibilities in roles."
2564,2022-03-21T12:47:58.238000+00:00,"Even then, it depends where you want to end up. I work at an agency, all products we make are 'new' products. That doesn't mean the UX team does the role of the marketing team."
2565,2022-03-21T12:45:58.678000+00:00,"I agree with all of the above, but my project prompt is --- Design an app for XYZ. So, I figured I had to approach it from a product design/new product launch scope"
2566,2022-03-21T12:45:24.081000+00:00,Unless your goal is to validate the app in a business sense as a business model.
2567,2022-03-21T12:45:01.097000+00:00,Market research is not UX research in that sense.
2568,2022-03-21T12:44:39.579000+00:00,Competitive research for research of usage can be very different.
2569,2022-03-21T12:44:20.789000+00:00,Gaps and opportunities is market oriented research
2570,2022-03-21T12:43:34.510000+00:00,Same with your competitive research. Market competitive research is not UX competitive research.
2571,2022-03-21T12:43:18.860000+00:00,"They can be, but it's important to separate."
2572,2022-03-21T12:42:58.008000+00:00,Using is not buying
2573,2022-03-21T12:42:51.598000+00:00,"Blog users are users, not costumers, the scope is a bit different"
2574,2022-03-21T12:42:35.828000+00:00,There's a small difference in your case.
2575,2022-03-21T12:41:39.707000+00:00,"Just to reiterate, I should validate what consumers are not saying/gaps in the competitor's/opportunities?"
2576,2022-03-21T12:40:39.328000+00:00,For E-commerce it's very often costumer journey map yeah
2577,2022-03-21T12:40:07.955000+00:00,"Yeah, even for a big industry like e-commerce --- I Have mostly seen end to end comprehensive journey maps"
2578,2022-03-21T12:40:01.500000+00:00,Only from dis-connections
2579,2022-03-21T12:39:54.875000+00:00,You can not learn from connections
2580,2022-03-21T12:39:42.704000+00:00,Otherwise you're just feeding your conformation bias
2581,2022-03-21T12:39:33.483000+00:00,Instead validate the opposite
2582,2022-03-21T12:38:27.198000+00:00,But I wouldn't do it at a blog app
2583,2022-03-21T12:37:57.532000+00:00,"If we had a research goal like ""HMW more people vote?"" or ""HMW let people separate their garbage?"" then empathy maps become interesting"
2584,2022-03-21T12:36:23.484000+00:00,"But yeah, practically. Unless you're researching some kind of big social issue, like recycling, global warming, presidential elections, this isn't a method you'd use (empathy mapping)."
2585,2022-03-21T12:36:06.125000+00:00,"That's a good point, I'll try to see if I can find some related interview transcripts and validate it further"
2586,2022-03-21T12:35:11.938000+00:00,Well it depends. Marketeers have the flaw of being very certain of uncertain things sometimes üòÇ
2587,2022-03-21T12:32:33.581000+00:00,"Yep, and one of the options under the SAY option is ""What can we **imagine **them saying"" ----- I can easily answer this question based on the survey, competitive analysis, journals and marketing reports ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è"
2588,2022-03-21T12:30:41.642000+00:00,It's more used for extensive generative research I suppose
2589,2022-03-21T12:29:26.494000+00:00,
2590,2022-03-21T12:28:51.430000+00:00,"Yes, especially the newer version of the empathy map is pretty crazy"
2591,2022-03-21T12:26:25.249000+00:00,"Thanks for helping out, otherwise I would have created an empathy map simply for the sake of it."
2592,2022-03-21T12:24:15.341000+00:00,"Many courses teach it anyway, since it's good to be aware of its existence."
2593,2022-03-21T12:23:00.441000+00:00,In the sense that you're interested in a day and a likelyhood of reading blogs
2594,2022-03-21T12:22:39.926000+00:00,"In your case a journey map can be interesting, as your research goals are time based."
2595,2022-03-21T12:22:18.097000+00:00,Same for journeys maps and personas
2596,2022-03-21T12:21:33.798000+00:00,"Well it can be interesting to make one, but only if you got a very good reason to do so. It's not a checkbox you need to mark."
2597,2022-03-21T12:21:01.201000+00:00,"Yes!! Thank you for validating this! As I read more about the maps, it seems more and more like an unnecessary extra step. I personally prefer to look at the research findings and the persona/user story/journey maps directly before prototyping."
2598,2022-03-21T12:19:17.859000+00:00,Except maybe some hip service designers
2599,2022-03-21T12:18:58.238000+00:00,"Nope, barely anyone ever uses an empathy map in the real world (speaking from anecdotal evidence)"
2600,2022-03-21T12:18:38.002000+00:00,What time of the day people read blogs is definitely fit for a survey I suppose.
2601,2022-03-21T12:16:27.623000+00:00,"Just some specific patterns in user behavior, say for eg: what time of the day are people more likely to use a blogging app? My primary concern was that as I prepping my designs and portfolio, whether the lack of an empathy map would have any impact for hiring managers."
2602,2022-03-21T12:13:06.854000+00:00,What are you hoping to learn?
2603,2022-03-21T12:12:25.366000+00:00,"Yep, a lot of the data was already available -- so I conducted the survey only to validate a few assumptions and value proposition of the product."
2604,2022-03-21T12:10:16.458000+00:00,You can do competitive analysis yeah. Do you have concrete metrics / research questions that scope what you want to have answered from this research?
2605,2022-03-21T12:07:19.176000+00:00,"Thanks for replying üôÇ . Yes, its a student project, however, I am under the self study umbrella ( with a bit of the Google course sprinkled in ). Hence, I am unable to recruit participants. I do have a lot of competitor analysis data and reviews from actual users -- So I was wondering if it was feasible to draw insights from there."
2606,2022-03-21T12:04:48.573000+00:00,"If it's a student project, getting interviews for free isn't hard"
2607,2022-03-21T12:00:22.304000+00:00,"Heyo Kristie

1: The sample size depends on the nature of the questions & size of the pool

2: You wouldn't really get a lot of value out of empathy maps if you don't do interviewing."
2608,2022-03-21T11:17:10.464000+00:00,"Hey all, I had a couple of queries regarding research for my projects ---- 1. Is a sample size of 30+ good enough for initial UX research survey? 2. I don't have the budget for interviews, can I construct empathy maps from other UX research methods?"
2609,2022-03-19T11:12:37.650000+00:00,Only done recruiting during my studies.
2610,2022-03-19T11:12:18.453000+00:00,"Yeah, sadly I don't have a lot of real work recruiting experience. We just pay recruiting agencies."
2611,2022-03-19T05:10:35.810000+00:00,"I've been posting links in various subreddits with like, at least tens of thousands of people but I'm still at less than 10 respondents :("
2612,2022-03-19T05:10:06.341000+00:00,mm.. the thing is I'm struggling with the recruitment instead of running the tests
2613,2022-03-18T13:43:39.600000+00:00,"Ok, maybe I can share that, right now I have prompts that I will be asking participants as they are using the prototype"

2616,2022-03-18T09:54:44.787000+00:00,Maze isn't a recruitment platform like userinterview.com though
2617,2022-03-18T09:54:14.247000+00:00,You'd be better of doing separate recruiting and providing the maze link then
2618,2022-03-18T09:40:34.317000+00:00,"like if i want my user demographics to be malaysia, i'm curious if that's possible, or at least have enough participants... i dont think there's a lot of malaysians on that platform üòÖ"
2619,2022-03-18T09:39:24.178000+00:00,"we use english, but i see userinterview.com and surveyswap.io specifically say they recruit from US,UK, Canada etc only and i wonder if Maze is the same"
2620,2022-03-18T09:22:21.601000+00:00,"So if you have another language you must recruit your own people, but can still use Maze"
2621,2022-03-18T09:22:03.729000+00:00,Maze only recruits english speaking participants; mostly US
2622,2022-03-18T09:20:10.789000+00:00,For the recruitment?
2623,2022-03-18T08:14:29.423000+00:00,Does anyone know if maze.co is world-wide or only available to specific regions/countries?
2624,2022-03-18T07:36:34.082000+00:00,If you share the testscript here we can give feedback

2626,2022-03-17T23:00:47.920000+00:00,If yes write out a brief to help them understand the situation and tasks  when you‚Äôre making the script and tasks make sure you don‚Äôt directly reference the CTA names and components otherwise you will lose a lot of the insights
2627,2022-03-17T22:58:56.869000+00:00,Do your friends belong in your targeted user group
2628,2022-03-17T22:58:29.013000+00:00,What is the success criteria
2629,2022-03-17T22:58:26.046000+00:00,I would write a plan for the usability study what specifically feature wise are you testing
2630,2022-03-17T21:48:53.720000+00:00,"Hey friends, I need to conduct a usability study and I don't know where to begin. I am debating how to conduct the study and get a good screen recording while they are conducting the study. 

I was debating if I should do it in-person or through zoom. If I do it while we're hanging out (with friends) I worry they wont be in the mood to take the study seriously and if I do it through zoom I worry about the participants having tech issues with recording their screens. 

Am I overthinking it? What do you suggest? 

Thank you in advanced."
2631,2022-03-17T18:23:12.671000+00:00,Has anyone put just a journey map in their portfolios? It involved a lot from an interview and design perspective but I usually see them as part of an overall site/app design
2632,2022-03-17T13:58:38.417000+00:00,My company uses optimal sort for it. you can jerry rig and do card sorting on figjam or muro as well
2633,2022-03-17T08:32:42.319000+00:00,"However, if you're planning to use closed card sorting you can also use Maze"
2634,2022-03-17T08:32:16.565000+00:00,We usually use optimal sort indeed!
2635,2022-03-17T06:07:54.767000+00:00,thank you üòÑ
2636,2022-03-17T05:37:10.675000+00:00,"I haven't used this personally, but for work rn I'm doing research into research tools and this looks pretty promising
https://www.optimalworkshop.com/optimalsort/"
2637,2022-03-17T04:19:27.004000+00:00,"**Does anyone have a card sorting tool they would recommend? **(paid ok) we'd love to do a server wide card sort to organize (and find channels to archive) in design buddies!

we've used this before - https://kardsort.com/ however, i had to manually analyze the data bc i dont have a PC to get the 3rd party app needed üò¶"
2638,2022-03-16T19:23:36.063000+00:00,But much more being a consultant
2639,2022-03-16T19:23:28.958000+00:00,As far as I‚Äôm experiencing now though the work experience is partly teaching research
2640,2022-03-16T19:15:51.929000+00:00,Where deliverables will be white papers that will be published
2641,2022-03-16T19:15:21.179000+00:00,Or within government
2642,2022-03-16T19:15:15.308000+00:00,Doing UX research at a university for example
2643,2022-03-16T19:15:02.738000+00:00,I‚Äôve noticed they ask for PhD here on more academic focused jobs
2644,2022-03-16T19:11:38.028000+00:00,"PhD for sure, masters only for the thesis so not the full 2 years"
2645,2022-03-16T19:11:01.884000+00:00,It‚Äôs Research work experience in theory yeah
2646,2022-03-16T14:46:47.674000+00:00,"If you say 15yrs work experience and most of your experience is in academia, I'm not sure many people would make the connection of 7yrs of phd as 7yrs of work experience."
2647,2022-03-16T14:45:52.256000+00:00,Disclaimer! I could be completely wrong with the following statements - From what I understand about PhDs are they typically lead to tenure professor? So it may be to address some of the confusion and encourage academics leaving academia to apply to the roles even.
2648,2022-03-16T14:43:26.923000+00:00,I think UX Research is one of the few jobs where there is a direct funnel to a job after extensive higher education.
2649,2022-03-16T14:42:44.292000+00:00,Maybe to highlight that PhD and Masters count as work experience?
2650,2022-03-16T14:20:43.197000+00:00,"Probably, but I always thought it was interesting that it was like a tier list"
2651,2022-03-16T14:02:03.078000+00:00,"masters 2yrs + 4-5yrs
PhD 7yrs + 2-3yrs"
2652,2022-03-16T14:01:40.749000+00:00,"I think if you break down the years, they still equal the same number."
2653,2022-03-16T14:00:08.413000+00:00,"Also they make it as a tier which is interesting. Like when I was looking for senior researcher roles it was like 7 years of experience, or 4-5 years of experience +  a masters, or 2-3 years of experience + PhD"
2654,2022-03-16T13:30:54.187000+00:00,But I probably don't agree on the distinction for phd for lead/director level roles.
2655,2022-03-16T13:29:38.838000+00:00,Makes sense for a lot of the more technical work. A lot of jobs and skills can be taught but some take a significant amount of time and are harder to teach.
2656,2022-03-16T13:12:59.308000+00:00,"In the US I see that now they started asking for a Masters, but they only ask for a PhD when it comes to lead or director level roles"
2657,2022-03-16T07:54:30.383000+00:00,"And rarely PhD, but you sometimes see it"
2658,2022-03-16T07:54:10.133000+00:00,Sometimes masters
2659,2022-03-16T07:54:00.961000+00:00,(In NL)
2660,2022-03-16T07:53:54.351000+00:00,Most of the applications I see ask for minimum Bachelor too
2661,2022-03-16T02:37:43.548000+00:00,https://blog.uxfol.io/ux-researcher-salary/ they posted this on GRUX and it has a section on education
2662,2022-03-15T22:17:28.400000+00:00,"Lots of my colleagues do, but not all"
2663,2022-03-15T22:16:25.837000+00:00,I don‚Äôt have masters either üëÄ
2664,2022-03-15T21:12:32.001000+00:00,It might help but depending on your experience and knowledge on different research methodologies can help
2665,2022-03-15T21:11:54.992000+00:00,I don't think so
2666,2022-03-15T20:51:40.227000+00:00,I have a bachelor degree in information science from a prestigious university. Do I need a masters in HCI or a related field to do UX research? I have a lot of research experience
2667,2022-03-14T19:37:58.486000+00:00,UX industry is also a lot more saturated in the US (I think)
2668,2022-03-14T19:35:42.098000+00:00,"But surely, that's okay."
2669,2022-03-14T19:34:00.967000+00:00,Or something like that
2670,2022-03-14T19:33:58.216000+00:00,"But soon it may be Liberty Global, which is telecom instead of DIY"
2671,2022-03-14T19:33:57.162000+00:00,"Nice, home stuff."
2672,2022-03-14T19:33:10.031000+00:00,"Home Depot things; at least for the last months. Next few weeks may be different again,"
2673,2022-03-14T19:32:57.534000+00:00,Everyone know shopify
2674,2022-03-14T19:32:36.170000+00:00,Well I'm currently actually mainly doing research for DIY stores (e-commerce)
2675,2022-03-14T19:32:12.009000+00:00,sorry not to respond to you earlier.
2676,2022-03-14T19:32:06.671000+00:00,"not necessarily from my experience, but I will get back to you on that on DM."
2677,2022-03-14T19:31:44.916000+00:00,Oh ok
2678,2022-03-14T19:31:43.999000+00:00,<@!209640428151111680> i might end up asking you more questions in the future. Is that going to be okay? I feel like i might need your example of how you were eventually able to get your path from just being interested in IoT into IoT ux research
2679,2022-03-14T19:31:41.203000+00:00,Netherlands
2680,2022-03-14T19:31:36.998000+00:00,Isn't not having a degree a bad stereotype in majority of the world?
2681,2022-03-14T19:31:32.233000+00:00,NL?
2682,2022-03-14T19:31:15.039000+00:00,And schools/uni are largely government controlled.
2683,2022-03-14T19:30:19.868000+00:00,Not having a degree in the NL is a very bad stereo type.
2684,2022-03-14T19:29:37.836000+00:00,Hiring markets and also 'degrees' are very different in the NL than in the US
2685,2022-03-14T19:29:22.963000+00:00,"Yeah, also take in mind this is based on a Dutch perspective."
2686,2022-03-14T19:26:23.901000+00:00,"<@!209640428151111680> I will definitely have to take some time and settle this in. Right now to a guy who has a psych degree with some prior experience in Education... im telling you that imma complete novice to this field, and you've just helped me opening my eyes to this field in different way"
2687,2022-03-14T19:24:27.528000+00:00,Now I'd have to know which Uni you're taking that course at
2688,2022-03-14T19:23:59.302000+00:00,hahaha we can talk about it more in DM lmao
2689,2022-03-14T19:23:36.809000+00:00,i plan to go to canada <:Wowzas:851337983319212052>
2690,2022-03-14T19:23:18.048000+00:00,.....but now my focus is changing.
2691,2022-03-14T19:23:11.509000+00:00,"like I mentioned earlier, I am taking a ux course at a university here in Canada... but i was only thinking about getting a certificate and building a nice well looking portfolio"
2692,2022-03-14T19:22:27.988000+00:00,thank you. you just helped me opening my eyes to another level or another perspective of the world of UX
2693,2022-03-14T19:22:00.262000+00:00,Ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
2694,2022-03-14T19:21:38.747000+00:00,Even though I now do not work at an agency that does just IoT; though their one case on IoT was some leverage.
2695,2022-03-14T19:21:13.875000+00:00,So IoT companies will find that interesting.
2696,2022-03-14T19:20:50.394000+00:00,"I very much loved to do IoT, so most of my cases were IoT related."
2697,2022-03-14T19:20:27.245000+00:00,"Not necessarily. You do you, the company is the one who will fit."
2698,2022-03-14T19:20:00.111000+00:00,"...it's funny cuz i don't even know what desk-research is yet, but im about to look it up what it is lol"
2699,2022-03-14T19:19:35.880000+00:00,aha... desk-research... and that's how you make your portfolio to the company i guess? cuz then you are shaping yours to make it more attractive.
2700,2022-03-14T19:18:59.336000+00:00,Brand perspective for example
2701,2022-03-14T19:18:46.176000+00:00,"Only market research, so testing advertising campaigns with people."
2702,2022-03-14T19:18:24.167000+00:00,"Well in theory, the I'd first do 'desk-research' write and application based on that research; then if I'm invited I will just have my questions directly."
2703,2022-03-14T19:17:48.854000+00:00,Have you ever encountered one with a Marketing/Advertising background
2704,2022-03-14T19:16:13.404000+00:00,...so it's the same concept then?
2705,2022-03-14T19:16:03.665000+00:00,ask a question and see what you can offer the user.
2706,2022-03-14T19:15:29.109000+00:00,How would you do it if the company was a user?
2707,2022-03-14T19:14:47.969000+00:00,cuz now I need an advice on how to do some research about a company before you apply... but that's like that depend on situation I guess?
2708,2022-03-14T19:14:19.138000+00:00,".....i do want to ask one more question, but I am not sure how much you could answer then"
2709,2022-03-14T19:13:23.924000+00:00,that's amazing.
2710,2022-03-14T19:13:01.213000+00:00,Even a data scientist
2711,2022-03-14T19:12:40.137000+00:00,"The rest have psych backgrounds, or qual market research backgrounds"
2712,2022-03-14T19:12:11.159000+00:00,I'm in a team of 11 researchers. I think only 2-3 have design backgrounds.
2713,2022-03-14T19:11:24.471000+00:00,"I am sorry for having a lot of questions here... 
...but from your response, do you think that people who eventually want to be a ux researcher could straight end up as a ux researcher or they need to have portfolio ready for the position of uxd first then after some time they apply to become a ux researcher?

... i guess my question is that...
do potential ux researchers need the prior experience of uxd before they become a ux researcher?"
2714,2022-03-14T19:08:45.727000+00:00,....did i get that correct?
2715,2022-03-14T19:08:41.731000+00:00,"....so what you are telling me, if I just sum it up, a life of ux researcher at an agency could be different from a life of ux researcher at a company that has both ux designer and ux researcher"
2716,2022-03-14T19:07:57.480000+00:00,interesting
2717,2022-03-14T19:07:42.187000+00:00,"The designers still have their theories, though the big pro I have compared to the designers is that I don't always know how they designed it. Thus resulting in less bias, or some subconscious expectation of how the user will react. Though also not completely free."
2718,2022-03-14T19:06:26.665000+00:00,"At our agency the UXD might do research, but it's probably low budget. So if they do have a big research budget, I will mainly collaborate with the designers. Who will help and brainstorm about what to test, but they will not moderate, recruit, write testscripts or create the final report."
2719,2022-03-14T19:04:39.038000+00:00,All while working together very closely with stakeholders (including designers)
2720,2022-03-14T19:04:23.883000+00:00,"As a UXR at an agency my life is very simple. 

I plan research > Execute Research > Write reports."
2721,2022-03-14T19:03:22.327000+00:00,For the difference it's a very difficult question and will change for each company.
2722,2022-03-14T19:02:59.940000+00:00,Going with a portfolio is always the better chance. I imagine there aren't many situations where a portfolio would be a con. Unless you put in very weird things.
2723,2022-03-14T19:02:08.307000+00:00,Do you need a portfolio? not necessarily. Will it increase your chances of being hired? 100%
2724,2022-03-14T19:01:13.878000+00:00,go for it.
2725,2022-03-14T19:00:55.076000+00:00,"I'll just let you focus on the important stuff Jang, may I DM you tomorrow instead?"
2726,2022-03-14T19:00:32.565000+00:00,hello! Dario. I would appreciate it if you could answer both questions please
2727,2022-03-14T19:00:06.150000+00:00,"I'm back I suppose. What's really the question though, is it ""Do I need a portfolio?"" or is it ""What does a UXR do differently than a UXD?"""
2728,2022-03-14T19:00:00.906000+00:00,".....im not sure how deep this conversation needs to be personal, but im just kinda listening lol"
2729,2022-03-14T18:59:54.433000+00:00,"this might be going a lil off topic, i believe we should switch channels"
2730,2022-03-14T18:59:22.093000+00:00,....and it does sound normal to me.
2731,2022-03-14T18:59:17.079000+00:00,ok. i was just checking
2732,2022-03-14T18:59:07.275000+00:00,Well yes
2733,2022-03-14T18:58:33.089000+00:00,because u are a high schooler?
2734,2022-03-14T18:58:27.295000+00:00,parents...?
2735,2022-03-14T18:57:16.331000+00:00,"And then **parents** enter the play, where they want a degree of some sort"
2736,2022-03-14T18:56:35.784000+00:00,"Yes, I have heard of that too"
2737,2022-03-14T18:56:01.960000+00:00,"Yes, I am aware of the paths I could choose from. But it's like, most UX Programs I looked for in the destination I plan to go to, required a portfolio beforehand"
2738,2022-03-14T18:54:06.300000+00:00,...and there are people who go to colleges or universities to understand this field better
2739,2022-03-14T18:53:50.224000+00:00,there are people who take courses online for this field and study by themselves.
2740,2022-03-14T18:53:32.323000+00:00,...but what I know is that...
2741,2022-03-14T18:53:20.902000+00:00,that's a good question because I am also looking for the answer
2742,2022-03-14T18:53:11.103000+00:00,hmmm
2743,2022-03-14T18:53:08.045000+00:00,how the hell do i become one?
2744,2022-03-14T18:52:56.383000+00:00,"anyways, so let's go back to your original question"
2745,2022-03-14T18:52:47.217000+00:00,"Oh great. 
perhaps you are better than i have expected."
2746,2022-03-14T18:52:30.485000+00:00,"No no, I get it. I just was not able to frame the sentence right"
2747,2022-03-14T18:51:33.816000+00:00,"....which is still very difficult to understand for you, I assume?"
2748,2022-03-14T18:51:09.164000+00:00,"Yes, so from how I understand, the simplest way to describe what this field is : understand how people use a product feel and investigate how to let them feel better, and remake the product to apply what people suggest to experience better."
2749,2022-03-14T18:50:05.385000+00:00,I understand what you're trying to say but I cannot formulate a sentence that would make my understanding be clear
2750,2022-03-14T18:49:42.116000+00:00,design of pots and how people feel when they use them could be part of UX Design...
2751,2022-03-14T18:49:26.655000+00:00,...or doesn't have to be even bound to the digital products either
2752,2022-03-14T18:49:02.749000+00:00,"As in, generally they are bound to digital products"
2753,2022-03-14T18:49:00.441000+00:00,"....even just randomly think about the car itself, there are so many ways that UX design could be applied in my opinion?"
2754,2022-03-14T18:48:41.872000+00:00,"design of a handle, texture of a handle, what shape and how does it feel to drive overall..."
2755,2022-03-14T18:48:16.172000+00:00,sure you could....?
2756,2022-03-14T18:48:02.079000+00:00,"Yes, I realise that but you won't be tasked with a car when u apply as a UX designer would you?"
2757,2022-03-14T18:47:25.716000+00:00,based on my own expereince
2758,2022-03-14T18:47:18.470000+00:00,....but it's actually for everything
2759,2022-03-14T18:47:14.069000+00:00,those youtubers might focus on apps or websites
2760,2022-03-14T18:47:02.811000+00:00,"no, actually I find the explanation to be a lot more vague and general than that"
2761,2022-03-14T18:46:40.459000+00:00,"I feel its a good explanation, but it just can't be that simple, is it"
2762,2022-03-14T18:46:11.328000+00:00,"because Youtube is not the ultimate source, if I would speak of myself."
2763,2022-03-14T18:45:30.808000+00:00,Thats basically what every youtube video keeps ending at
2764,2022-03-14T18:45:06.492000+00:00,"as much as I can tell, from how much I understand, you've got it a bit then"
2765,2022-03-14T18:44:55.726000+00:00,nice nice nice
2766,2022-03-14T18:44:15.058000+00:00,"I would say an individual who indulges in solving a user's problems while using an app, be it navigation of the elements present on the screen, their visuals (how soothing they are to the eyes), basically someone like an architect but for websites/apps"
2767,2022-03-14T18:42:19.240000+00:00,what the heck are UX Designers then?
2768,2022-03-14T18:42:12.797000+00:00,For ex) lawyers are people who get referrals and defend the people at a court. police officers are people who ensure that people in the city obeys the rules.
2769,2022-03-14T18:40:58.522000+00:00,"what the heck is ""UX Designer""?"
2770,2022-03-14T18:40:49.925000+00:00,then i would like to ask you a simple question:
2771,2022-03-14T18:40:38.404000+00:00,I am happy to hear it
2772,2022-03-14T18:40:35.216000+00:00,okay at least that seems to be quite clear.
2773,2022-03-14T18:40:12.294000+00:00,"I'm dead set to become a UX Designer, it's like I know **what** I want to do but not **how** I have to do it"
2774,2022-03-14T18:39:38.555000+00:00,"....so even if you graduate from high school, college or university, the confusion will carry on."
2775,2022-03-14T18:39:17.177000+00:00,except some people who know what the heck they wanna do straight from the beginning.
2776,2022-03-14T18:38:54.871000+00:00,that's probably what a lot of people feel every day
2777,2022-03-14T18:38:43.861000+00:00,"you feel confused, you said?"
2778,2022-03-14T18:38:37.977000+00:00,I am a former teacher... and so I can tell you a bit to face the reality that I don't even know what the hell is going on much enough
2779,2022-03-14T18:38:15.231000+00:00,"now, second is..."
2780,2022-03-14T18:38:11.729000+00:00,I am no different human being compared to you.
2781,2022-03-14T18:38:05.968000+00:00,"you've let me know of your age, so I kinda wanted to play fair."
2782,2022-03-14T18:37:54.825000+00:00,I'm somewhere in 20s.
2783,2022-03-14T18:37:47.907000+00:00,"first, let me touch on this."
2784,2022-03-14T18:37:41.289000+00:00,......okay
2785,2022-03-14T18:37:32.083000+00:00,all of it confuses me more and more
2786,2022-03-14T18:37:10.455000+00:00,"Do I attend courses, unis, bootcamps"
2787,2022-03-14T18:36:29.547000+00:00,"Like, I'm currently a high schooler, and want to pursue this field of work but I just cannot seem to get what to do after school"
2788,2022-03-14T18:35:30.436000+00:00,Im really confused as to how to get into UX from a student perspective
2789,2022-03-14T18:34:31.493000+00:00,alright see u soon
2790,2022-03-14T18:34:25.621000+00:00,"....because then if I want to apply for a job at a particular company, but if I have no background understanding regarding what the hell they do... then im basically losing my chance ain't it?"
2791,2022-03-14T18:34:10.172000+00:00,"Having dinner, brb!"
2792,2022-03-14T18:33:32.654000+00:00,....so it's like you would have no idea where exactly you would be needed nor how you will be needed in the company without digging it directly from them?
2793,2022-03-14T18:32:58.251000+00:00,"i kinda get that. thank you for touching it.
i guess that i am still feeling a bit confused."
2794,2022-03-14T18:32:35.056000+00:00,"for your question, I think that depends on each person. there are platforms out there that allows you to study the field by yourself and there are courses you can take at an institution like my case."
2795,2022-03-14T18:31:52.452000+00:00,"I'm curious, has everyone studied about UX here from Universities or any folks that did it themselves?"
2796,2022-03-14T18:31:26.496000+00:00,I guess the biggest difference is in that research is a highly communicative role
2797,2022-03-14T18:30:36.135000+00:00,"Usually (probably depends again) UX designers that do research do not write testscripts, or reports for client reading (all agency perspective)"
2798,2022-03-14T18:30:17.932000+00:00,...like where does the gap close to each other?
2799,2022-03-14T18:30:04.447000+00:00,"...and that's where my question comes from. I understand that when you make a portfolio, you may be telling a story of what you can do and what you've done well before... but then how do you match the expectation between what you can do and what the company expects?"
2800,2022-03-14T18:29:56.125000+00:00,You work will also be very different
2801,2022-03-14T18:28:54.069000+00:00,"Yes, I am because atm i am taking a course about UXD at a university here in Canada... and the instructor is educating us that UX design could be a role as it is and UX research is another role as it is although they may team up very heavy."
2802,2022-03-14T18:28:25.976000+00:00,"Once again, please do correct me if I'm wrong I'd love to learn"
2803,2022-03-14T18:28:20.291000+00:00,"So any UX researcher at my company, does only do UX research, no design"
2804,2022-03-14T18:27:48.434000+00:00,Research is part of the work process UX designer goes through
2805,2022-03-14T18:27:33.985000+00:00,At a research agency requirements are different than a UXD agency
2806,2022-03-14T18:27:10.948000+00:00,"I believe you're taking UX Designer and Researcher as two different Jobs. In most cases, its the same person doing both"
2807,2022-03-14T18:27:08.971000+00:00,"But in theory, a portfolio can only do good"
2808,2022-03-14T18:26:48.206000+00:00,"It really depends on the context of the company, and who's the one evaluating you. Some people apply with a masters psych degree and that's all they need."
2809,2022-03-14T18:25:28.646000+00:00,"P.s. do not take my words too seriously, I'm merely a 16 year old aspiring to enter this field"
2810,2022-03-14T18:25:22.299000+00:00,"....this might be a silly question to ask, but then does a portfolio for ux research highlight different aspects compared to a portfolio for a role in ux design?"
2811,2022-03-14T18:24:29.930000+00:00,yeah that would be my question cuz atm i've only been looking at ux design so far
2812,2022-03-14T18:24:26.242000+00:00,"Certifications work as add-ons, not the main highlight"
2813,2022-03-14T18:23:45.907000+00:00,From what I've learned about this is that any job for UX requires a portfolio
2814,2022-03-14T18:23:24.348000+00:00,"So the question is ""Do I need a portfolio for a research role?""?"
2815,2022-03-14T18:22:13.579000+00:00,"<@!209640428151111680> thank you for your response.
For myself, it's really more like....
do I need a portfolio for UX Research positions as well when comparing to UX Design position? 

...like i know that there are many roles in the field of UX Design, but what I understand is that a portfolio is essential regardless of the role

... but UX Research role is kind of a tangent role compared to other UX roles"
2816,2022-03-14T18:18:01.255000+00:00,"Is it

""How do I apply for a research role?""

""How do I research a company I apply to?""

Or something else even."
2817,2022-03-14T18:16:23.619000+00:00,"Your question also seems a bit indirect, so I assume you're looking for a different answer. What are you really trying to learn without reflecting it on someone else?"
2818,2022-03-14T18:11:54.828000+00:00,"First you apply. See what peaked your interest; type of projects etc. 

Then hopefully get invited... If you do you just ask them directly ""What is it like working here for you?""

The question may work better for <#717140490159652966> as it's the same with any other role."
2819,2022-03-14T17:27:29.713000+00:00,...or is the above question more appropriate for mentors...?
2820,2022-03-14T17:26:58.609000+00:00,"...basically, I would like to ask the following questions:

- let's say someone is potentially interested in becoming a UX Researcher for a company.

Q. how do you find out more information about the particular company and what project the company is working on?
...like how do you apply the role of UX Research in the practical reality?"
2821,2022-03-14T17:24:08.465000+00:00,Hello... so is this where I can throw some questions regarding a position of UX Research?
2822,2022-03-13T09:17:29.282000+00:00,I‚Äôll shoot you a DM monday!
2823,2022-03-12T20:47:40.464000+00:00,Bet. DM me and let‚Äôs see when we can do it then
2824,2022-03-12T20:46:35.769000+00:00,"I‚Äôd like to!

Also discussed it a bit with my senior. She said solution focused may be dangerous because it promises the solution towards the client"
2825,2022-03-12T02:33:30.029000+00:00,yee I have! but its been a while since I did. I can always post it again if ya like! and ooo yeye those are are some good topics to bring up
2826,2022-03-12T02:10:28.053000+00:00,"Did you post your website before? I haven't seen it so I can't say anything like that. And for questions I would think that something like about a typical work day, work load, team interactions, tools that you would be using, those are a few questions that I can think of"
2827,2022-03-12T01:56:36.313000+00:00,I'm thinking to do some jobs to be done and how might we's
2828,2022-03-12T01:56:19.023000+00:00,knowing what questions to ask would be good! but to also know what other steps to take for redesigning my website outside of getting interviews
2829,2022-03-12T01:38:55.001000+00:00,Like questions to ask or...?
2830,2022-03-12T01:38:41.222000+00:00,What do you mean?
2831,2022-03-12T01:25:36.799000+00:00,"oh gotchu gotchu, that does make sense. unfortunately, I havent gotten interviews yet but is good to keep in mind when the time comes around! though for the mean time what would you suggest?"
2832,2022-03-12T00:59:18.529000+00:00,"Usually during certain parts of the interview it would be the people that you would work with, and more often than not they will leave some time at the end for you to ask questions"
2833,2022-03-12T00:58:14.224000+00:00,It really depend what the research is for and the development stage that the project it is. Is it generative research at the beginning of the process or evaluative research that it's done more towards the end? There's not like a single parameter to talk about this. Let me know if you wanna talk about this and I can be more in detail about this
2834,2022-03-12T00:54:19.982000+00:00,"hello! I'm looking to redesign my portfolio website and been going through the UX motions. I'm at the interview part of the process. Does anybody know anyone who does interviews and if so, if they got the time for me to interview them?"
2835,2022-03-11T17:37:14.403000+00:00,"Soliciting recommendations or links for any best practices to conduct a Heuristic Audit / Evaluation? I'm thinking:
‚Ä¢ Research Brief to include:
> ‚Ä¢ Overview of Project
> ‚Ä¢ User segments & Personas
> ‚Ä¢ Platforms being audited
> ‚Ä¢ Use Cases
‚Ä¢ 1-3 evaluators
‚Ä¢ 1-5 tasks / jobs to be done (Use Cases)
‚Ä¢ Documentation tools: Airtable, Heurio, Google Drive for screengrabs & working documents
‚Ä¢ Deliverables:  Spreadsheet / data report; Audit Report presentation deck"
2836,2022-03-11T11:50:09.563000+00:00,Focus it towards a recommendation / best action to take or focus it to observing the current situation
2837,2022-03-11T11:49:27.860000+00:00,"Both are pretty bad generalized questions, but I'm mostly curious about the scope of the focus"
2838,2022-03-11T11:49:10.984000+00:00,"Do you make your research question 'solution focused' or 'observational focused'?

For example:

""How do user perceive the information architecture of X?""

Or

""What is the best way to represent the information architecture of X?"""
2839,2022-03-11T11:47:06.785000+00:00,Question to my more senior researchers:
2840,2022-03-09T20:51:33.105000+00:00,Thanks! This looks similar to something I downloaded today. Good to know that there are programs that put together what I am trying to do in a more streamlined way üòÑ
2841,2022-03-09T20:03:27.747000+00:00,Hi. Does anyone have resources on mock interviews? Would really appreciate the help. Thanks!
2842,2022-03-09T18:24:18.074000+00:00,Dovetail but it‚Äôs not free
2843,2022-03-09T17:10:33.233000+00:00,What templates you really like using for capturing insights during or after user interviews? My workflow has been excel spreadsheet --> free form Miro document (for affinity mapping) but wonder if there are better ways of doing this <:ThinkEyes:711813052433039370>
2844,2022-03-08T09:14:26.705000+00:00,"Hello! 
Any suggestion for a journey mapping workshop with users and clients?"
2845,2022-03-08T07:41:41.118000+00:00,For each the format will be different and for non there‚Äôs a format that fits all.
2846,2022-03-08T07:40:17.771000+00:00,"The stakeholder that doesn‚Äôt really care.

The designer that needs to take action on it.

The researcher that wants to use it for their own research."
2847,2022-03-08T07:39:16.864000+00:00,Now I could communicate this to different people
2848,2022-03-08T07:35:39.887000+00:00,"So in that light the ‚ÄúI‚Äù statement is an observation, definitely not an insight"
2849,2022-03-08T07:30:20.684000+00:00,"Then we could triangulate this with secondary research about frustration in coming home in a messy home. 

‚ÄúSmart Professor X concludes the higher frustration is due to an increase of dopamine caused by the unexpectedness of the surprise.‚Äù

Maybe do some quant research as well to support it with a nice stat

‚Äú85/100 of respondents report feeling frustrated when they come home to a messy house‚Äù"
2850,2022-03-08T07:22:35.279000+00:00,"For me it depends who I‚Äôm presenting it to.

Probably a 100 ways of writing it down. An ‚ÄúI‚Äù statement may work nicely in some Jira card.

Personally I just write it down that it‚Äôs short but elaborate enough. For example:

‚ÄúParticipant feels frustrated when they come home to a messy house, because X and Y. When they feel frustrated they take a walk in the park, that makes them feel calm and puts the situation in perspective.‚Äù"
2851,2022-03-08T07:04:15.663000+00:00,Like ‚ÄúI feel frustrated when I come home and the house is messy‚Äù?
2852,2022-03-08T07:02:27.795000+00:00,<@!804391016702017587>
2853,2022-03-08T07:00:16.911000+00:00,‚ÄúI‚Äù statement? Could you elaborate?
2854,2022-03-08T06:37:29.615000+00:00,"Thanks for the insights! really interesting to hear. Curious to know without creating a persona, do you guys just present them as like specific insights in ""I"" statements? As a jr ux designer, what I learnt from bootcamp is very structural so after affinity mapping, we will create a persona. I am wondering how do we present the interview findings say if we don't use a persona?"
2855,2022-03-07T19:59:07.071000+00:00,I guess my no-personas comment should have a caveat. I think marketing personas are great. Just not for product design
2856,2022-03-07T19:57:43.107000+00:00,For stakeholders
2857,2022-03-07T19:57:39.953000+00:00,Or more as a political instrument
2858,2022-03-07T19:52:29.964000+00:00,Where you want to save some insights for some years
2859,2022-03-07T19:52:07.731000+00:00,I feel they work better for non agency environments
2860,2022-03-07T19:48:34.099000+00:00,"Every team works differently, I think that if you can use personas in a way that benefits your team or you work‚Äîcreate and use personas that suit your needs"
2861,2022-03-07T19:47:50.970000+00:00,No personas is best personas
2862,2022-03-07T19:46:11.824000+00:00,Honestly I‚Äôve no idea.
2863,2022-03-07T19:36:00.660000+00:00,Or just well written reports
2864,2022-03-07T19:30:32.291000+00:00,UX researchers with whips overseeing designers
2865,2022-03-07T19:12:44.233000+00:00,what do you think is the 2022 version of personas?
2866,2022-03-07T16:26:27.977000+00:00,You could turn it into some first JTBDs
2867,2022-03-07T16:23:34.475000+00:00,Still insightful to talk to 4 users just as a way of starting generative research imo
2868,2022-03-07T14:46:16.715000+00:00,"While personas may not be a popular deliverable for many researchers nowadays, it is likely that many organizations have already established knowledge for the business and teams. 

There's a bit of discrepancy when it comes to what persona research really is vs what entry level ux'ers are taught."
2869,2022-03-07T14:42:58.435000+00:00,"Persona research requires quite a lot more than 4 users and is actually quite a big resource requiring methodology as it requires both quantitative and qualitative research. 

If you only have 4users, I recommend changing the direction to a different methodology."
2870,2022-03-07T07:57:23.409000+00:00,Personas aren't 2022
2871,2022-03-07T07:56:25.236000+00:00,Where I currently work we barely ever create personas though. Last time I created a persona was during my studies.
2872,2022-03-07T07:50:01.213000+00:00,"But 4 people will definitely give you some good info and some possible patterns, if there's really assignment 'make a persona' at least. Especially important then to scope your research very well."
2873,2022-03-07T07:49:15.036000+00:00,Since personas are attitudinal that can be different
2874,2022-03-07T07:47:44.353000+00:00,You need 5 users for a task-oriented behavioural usability task (like opening a door) it doesn't apply to all qualitative research. Even then it's assuming you do the task on expert level and have done everything perfectly with the perfect people.
2875,2022-03-07T02:56:57.643000+00:00,"Hi, I was taught that we need to interview at least 5 users to create a user persona. As we are having some difficulty recruiting users for interview, will 4 users be sufficient for me to form a persona and will these be considered as sufficient data points for the problem to be validated? Thanks!"
2876,2022-03-05T18:13:14.349000+00:00,And be advising
2877,2022-03-05T18:12:59.647000+00:00,No problem! So main thing; get a clear summary in there that answers your current research question
2878,2022-03-05T18:12:18.686000+00:00,Imma go and get some edits done.
2879,2022-03-05T18:12:05.833000+00:00,Thank you so much for your insights <@!209640428151111680> it really helps me!
2880,2022-03-05T18:11:20.414000+00:00,Can even be friends
2881,2022-03-05T18:10:08.106000+00:00,So either be creative or get people who you know
2882,2022-03-05T18:10:06.229000+00:00,I will add that!
2883,2022-03-05T18:09:49.496000+00:00,"That's the limitation of the research method. As in you're doing a lab test, while a field test would work better"

2886,2022-03-05T18:08:59.886000+00:00,"how do you suggest that I provide more detail if all the participants who joined my experiment was done via Zoom session? Like I didn't have them turned on their video cams, so I do not exactly know how to provide a description about it... how shall I make it up otherwise?"
2887,2022-03-05T18:08:19.465000+00:00,"Why could simply be ""Which one should I buy in my personal context?"""
2888,2022-03-05T18:07:52.035000+00:00,"Yeah, the why doesn't have to be difficult though"
2889,2022-03-05T18:07:12.045000+00:00,"Let people do the same task but in different physical context. Sitting position, laying down, on sofa with laptop of lap etc"
2890,2022-03-05T18:06:32.217000+00:00,"And since tracks and mousepads are physical products, maybe instead the physical context would even be more interesting."
2891,2022-03-05T18:06:26.730000+00:00,"The ""why"" part... ha... that's really the most challenging part in this assignment, I am assuming..."

2893,2022-03-05T18:04:31.710000+00:00,Example: you give people a lot of different tasks and see how trackpads vs mouses holds up in 10 different tasks for example. Because then you could really write something interesting and find the core value of why someone would want to use a mouse or trackpad in specific context
2894,2022-03-05T18:02:56.235000+00:00,So I guess one thing I'd think really hard on is; what are you really hoping to learn by analysing the use of a track-pad vs mouse
2895,2022-03-05T18:01:00.308000+00:00,Except if you're a researcher reading research reports

2919,2022-03-05T16:58:02.623000+00:00,"Hello everyone, 

I am a novice to UX design. I am currently taking a UX Design course at a university and I get some assignments to complete as the tasks help me to build a portfolio eventually (according to the instructor who teaches the course).

I have been given an assignment in relation to usability testing. The mission was to ask around about 5 people to draw squares on a classic paint program but they needed to do it twice: once using the mouse and second time using the trackpad. While the participants have completed the task, I have measure the duration of time for each participant as well.

I have created a summary report using quantitative data summary, but I would like to know if this is how you properly create the report.

Q. Am I supoosed to create a quantitative summary report?

Q. If yes, am I doing it properly?

**please note that the instructor is not very active in communication, so I couldn't get his response in timely manner. Having said that, I am reaching out to you, asking for your suggestion."
2920,2022-03-02T07:47:21.119000+00:00,"As a researcher your main priority shouldn't be pointing out the flaws, but pointing out how to solve them."
2921,2022-03-02T07:46:17.957000+00:00,"Looking good! 

Few points of improvement. Basically mainly the start and the end. 

In the introduction I miss some 'meaning'. Why did you want to know about product failures? What do you hope to gain from knowing so? You also state assumptions. How did you conclude those assumptions?

You then give some reasons of why they failed. Which seem like a few good reasons. However at the conclusion you give a new insight about the preconceived notions. Generally you don't want to add new information conclusion that has not been spoken out before. So this could be the last insight rather than part of the conclusion.

Then at the end you conclusion is *""If Microsoft were to utilize more user experience research and engineering, many of the flaws in Windows Vista could have been avoided.""*. However that's still a bit to generalized. Makes it sound like saying ""Had they used some more mayo on their fries, they would have been tastier.""

Instead you could shortly summarize each problem. Then specifically state how and which UXR method could solve which problem."

3076,2022-02-10T09:22:56.091000+00:00,aliright! I work in a small design firm and I'm more or less the only designer with some experience in research (not much as you can tell). Planning research alone when other people don't understand much of how it works is pretty challenging sometimes. (Usually i have to find the interviewees by myself too üòÖ )
3077,2022-02-10T09:21:23.833000+00:00,Though in this project that will heavily depend on the client side product owner.

3095,2022-02-10T08:56:23.141000+00:00,"I guess it's also stakeholder dependent maybe. Presenting the insights isn't just for the designers, it's also a way of communicating results to non-designers and clients etc."
3096,2022-02-10T08:50:47.838000+00:00,"It depends. Affinity mapping like that is more an immersive activity rather than analysis. It's effective because everyone is involved. It's an effective way of getting into the data and using collective knowledge to see different perspectives. It also ensures everyone is on the same page and is up to date. But it's not hard analysis. 

I guess a major difference is that this happens in teams where there's no dedicated researcher. But I'm unsure how other companies do this, or other UXR experience this. I don't do affinity mapping for one simple reason, I will not get the time for it."
3097,2022-02-10T08:37:01.956000+00:00,"Thanks! Very informative.

Another doubt i have could be this:

I tend to make a difference from findings and insights, which are probably the same thing you do calling them observations and insights. 

Anyways, to me insights from research are a level on abstraction that is already design work. It's not always the case that the insights it's the logical consequence of a group of findings (or better, should sound logical when you hear it but not necessarily trivial).

Usually i like when insights are group work. Using affinity maps to cluster group of  findings and collectively make insights emerge.

What do you think about this. It seems from the description of your process that you present the design team insights they can start designing with"

3108,2022-02-09T19:10:47.100000+00:00,"Mhh, may be partly that there's no clear scope. I'm not a designer, so I don't brainstorm with the insights, but hand them over. Roughly what I do is:

1: Prepare a script session with all those involved in the scope of the specific research. Usually design lead and PO. But can be with many really. In this script session I generally try to learn their challenges in the process. See where the 'blind spots' are. Basically ""What do we wish to learn?"" 

2: Then by myself. Structure everything and turn into research questions. Usually about three open questions. Turning goals into questions. 

3: Create an interview script with a profile, goals & scope, and interview guide. Share this script with stakeholders. The script basically acts as a discussion piece for scoping the research. Iterate on it. Probably ending somewhere with ScriptV6. 

4: Do interviews. 

5: Transcribe and analyse using closed coding. Where the codes relate to research questions. Open coding only when there's a lot of time.

6: Build up a report based on research questions and deliver."
3109,2022-02-09T18:17:48.496000+00:00,"It's probably both. 
I usually transcribe the interview notes in a text document. I carry on with all the interviews and in the end I end up with a lot of raw material.

- Firstly, I'm still searching for a good way to analyze that raw material and extract findings that are at a proper level of specificity for the phase we are in that moment.
- then, I struggle to present it to the team in clear and self evident way, so that we start working on that material to build the ideation phase.

but more generally, I was wondering what other designer do after conducting the interview, how they prefer to extract themes or findings from them, how they present them to colleagues and what they do next."
3110,2022-02-09T17:38:15.637000+00:00,"Is it about presenting them into a structured matter / communicating effectively, or about making it relevant to them?"

I would like to get some views on the interviews from some other designers.

I love doing research and really enjoy doing research through interviews. However, often when I finish conducting them, and the time comes to analyse and synthesise them into bits that can be used for ideation, I struggle with it. 

It is also very difficult to convey the findings to my colleagues and to convince them to work on them in order to find interesting insights for design.

How do you go about it?"

3119,2022-02-09T14:49:21.697000+00:00,As in when the person move from side to side?
3120,2022-02-09T14:44:23.033000+00:00,One thing that I learned the hard way is to have the eyes in the middle of the frame to minimize the amount of time that they get out of frame because depending on how long they are out of frame the thing can decalibrate
3121,2022-02-09T14:40:20.381000+00:00,Yup! Was quite easy to calibrate! Now people just need to come to the office for usertest instead of lookback
3122,2022-02-09T14:39:24.484000+00:00,But that‚Äôs awesome <@!209640428151111680> now you can do a bunch of really cool research and that desk mounted eye tracking is really nice and easy to work with imo
3123,2022-02-09T14:37:32.270000+00:00,That‚Äôs why when I configured it to record the screen I left that as small as I could on a corner lol
3124,2022-02-09T14:36:53.175000+00:00,It certainly does üòÇ
3125,2022-02-09T14:36:37.938000+00:00,Oh yeah I forget that the footage from the infrared camera looks like the Blair witch project lol
3126,2022-02-09T14:36:03.407000+00:00,I got the eye tracker working <@!419168292041785345>

3129,2022-02-07T23:03:11.418000+00:00,"1. Yes, my portfolio is a keynote
2. I would say *most* student projects showcase a lot of gaps from never working with a team and would recommend creating new case studies if you can. 

Portfolios are for you to put your best foot forward and showcase a side of you (Maybe you want to go into e-comm and you want to showcase the skill set that's relevant) that your resume doesn't show. 

3. Same company, different company, doesn't really matter as long as it is solid."
3130,2022-02-07T02:21:11.684000+00:00,And they can also provide a jumping platform for other projects that you might want to do for your portfolio
3131,2022-02-07T02:20:34.418000+00:00,I have a couple of projects that are several years old. If they are still good and don‚Äôt reflect poorly on you I wouldn‚Äôt see why them being a little old has to do with anything.
3132,2022-02-07T02:09:28.798000+00:00,"Hi everyone I had a few questions:

1. Has anyone ever done a PowerPoint for their portfolio? I've seen some examples online but I was curious if anyone had been hired while using one.

2. How long do you keep projects from undergrad or grad school in your portfolio? I'm going on 3 years post college working in ux for the same company it's probably time to take the college stuff out right?

3. When you're updating your portfolio how many projects from one company would you include? I've been at the same place for the last 3 years"

3137,2022-02-03T07:50:21.454000+00:00,Hi everyone! I'm doing research on a project that is geared towards gen z. I'm having a bit of trouble recruiting people to interview that fall into this age range. I was wondering - does anyone with similar experience have suggestions/tips on how I can better my outreach?
3138,2022-02-03T01:05:22.482000+00:00,I am a student and this project will be for my portfolio
3139,2022-02-03T00:06:52.210000+00:00,and is this for your personal use (case study or learning or portfolio) or is this for a company?
3140,2022-02-03T00:05:34.556000+00:00,Are you a student?
3141,2022-02-02T23:55:35.910000+00:00,Hi! I'm conducting my first usability studies this month and I am looking for some good templates for written consent of recording as well as information on how the participants PII's and SPII's will be protected. Does anyone have any good resources that I could use to get started on this? I want to make sure that participants know that their privacy will be protected.
3142,2022-02-02T21:05:46.848000+00:00,Hi! I finished working on my empathy map and am working on my persona to show what my needs and goals are of my users. But I feel that there is a lot of overlap like I am just copying and pasting the same information from the empathy map over to the persona. This is for a bootcamp project and I only had 5 participants btw!
3143,2022-02-02T21:02:33.493000+00:00,"While I might introduce some of the base commonalities of my users for specific contexts, I find it extremely rare that I need an entire persona study and artifact."
3144,2022-02-02T20:56:09.449000+00:00,"Hi Chelsea, 
Why are you working on personas? Is it because you are seeing portfolios with them or is there a clear need?

If there is a clear need for them, are you able to conduct persona research which is rigorous and requires a large set of data that is both quantitative and qualitative?"
3145,2022-02-02T20:51:53.311000+00:00,"I am also working on personas, and I am not sure if there is a right or wrong way to do them. Is it okay to do persona's based on the different goals?"
3146,2022-02-02T20:50:43.139000+00:00,"As a researcher, it is your responsibility to be impartial and provide unbiased data and observations. Your artifacts are an extension of your data and need to be thoroughly considered on how it could be interpreted."
3147,2022-02-02T20:48:49.988000+00:00,"When you create a persona, I recommend asking yourself why you're providing the information you are and how that can create bias within the audience."
3148,2022-02-02T20:46:38.280000+00:00,"Hi Matthew, when creating personas, brand and visuals aren't really important. 

Why you're creating the personas and what information you're relaying is much more important. I actively discourage junior researchers from displaying visuals because that is how we end up with design inequity."
3149,2022-02-02T19:15:41.213000+00:00,"for personas, people care more about the demographics of the person and their pain points and frustrations"
3150,2022-02-02T19:15:08.028000+00:00,<:depends:787105379179954217> on what you‚Äôre feeling brand and visual wise

3153,2022-02-02T19:09:05.827000+00:00,"i was wondering, when it comes to user personas, avatars are usually included"
3154,2022-02-02T19:08:54.972000+00:00,hey guys
3155,2022-01-29T22:04:00.831000+00:00,Thanks <@!589247034410926088> ! Will most likely need to go out there and get a better picture of the problem space.
3156,2022-01-29T06:04:27.652000+00:00,If they didn‚Äôt talk about it then maybe you need to go out agsin recruit a couple more until you see a good picture of the problem space
3157,2022-01-29T06:03:39.821000+00:00,About the technology and the space
3158,2022-01-29T06:03:34.277000+00:00,About meeting ppl online
3159,2022-01-29T06:03:29.872000+00:00,‚ÄúWhat do they hear‚Äù about online friends
3160,2022-01-29T05:00:46.102000+00:00,"I am working on my empathy map but am not quite understanding the section ""What do they hear?"". Does what they hear only relate to their pain points? 

And  this what they are literally hearing or things I assume they are hearing? My participants didn't really talk about what they heard. 

For context, my project is about redesigning a way for people to make friends through online applications. Think Bumble BFF."

3165,2022-01-27T05:38:06.261000+00:00,Hiiii! It's me again.... Is there a particular way to group personas from interview participants for an empathy map?
3166,2022-01-23T02:15:18.724000+00:00,Honestly I would focus on finding insights aka what are causing things to happen the way they are on what you prioritize first
3167,2022-01-23T02:14:41.772000+00:00,I mean usually yes according to ‚Äústructure‚Äù and ‚Äútheory‚Äù real life is different

3169,2022-01-22T07:13:19.475000+00:00,You‚Äôll have to then prioritize and figure out which one you want to work on and why
3170,2022-01-22T07:13:08.198000+00:00,Having multiple themes is fine and normal

I have quite a bit of experience doing this for the UX team with various different software but there isn't a singular way to do this. It is all dependent on the process and tools that the company is currently using. Someone with Research Ops experience is probably the person you'll need to assign this project out to > have someone on your team tinker the integrations and process > do it manually - are the three options you'll likely have to decide on."
3179,2022-01-20T18:35:09.908000+00:00,Does anyone have recommendations for tools/platforms for internal research? I'm trying to establish an easy and seamless way to for my Support team to submit customer feedback and requests to my Product Design team so we can process that data and prioritize it

3191,2022-01-19T16:24:57.345000+00:00,"I wouldn't necessarily expect a junior UX researcher to have great design sense, but once you get to the senior level your insights should be very actionable"
3192,2022-01-19T16:23:50.398000+00:00,"In my opinion, the depth of research isn't just in the method employed to gather data‚Äîbut also in the synthesis and outcome."
3193,2022-01-19T11:40:12.361000+00:00,"For a researcher 1-2yrs in, I don't really expect you to specialize but I do expect you to start taking more ownership with your work and take more initiative to explore and verbalize what you want in your own career **by asking questions**. 

It is the time to explore and spot opportunities that you want to take like maybe you've always wanted to try or learn how to do a diary study? Maybe you want to accessibility centered studies? Do more survey design? Maybe you want to even do some statistics? Bring that up to your manager. 

What are you doing each day to make incremental improvements? Are you making sure your questions aren't biased? Practicing building rapport with your participants in a short time? 

Again, these are conversations you can have with your manager in detail and ask about their own career trajectory and what decisions they made along the way to become a manager and ask role differences and what the slight nuances of decisions at each level entail."
3194,2022-01-19T11:36:53.802000+00:00,"Typically as a Junior you're doing both Quantitative and Qualitative Research not very well with the guidance of a Senior. 
Eventually around the time you start being more useful but not independent, you are unconsciously leaning towards deciding which type of Researcher (Quantitative or Qualitative) you want to be. I've typically seen researchers make that choice by weighing what they're showing promise for and which they enjoy more with the guidance of a Senior Researcher. 

Like many UX Researchers I've seen, it sounds like you are only doing qualitative research. Within qualitative research or research in general, what kind of research do you enjoy? Also, if you're having questions on this and your manager is a UX Research manager, you should be able to have these conversations with them and ask what growth could look like as a UX Researcher. 

#of methodologies does not make an entry level go to a mid-level. Personally, I believe that seniority can be measured by a mixture of the quality of work that displays through impact and the complexity of the studies that is often strategy."
3195,2022-01-19T02:35:55.535000+00:00,"Does anyone have a good resource about what UX research techniques you should be learning about at which point in your career? Eg, evaluative techniques for junior researchers and generative techniques for more senior researchers? What do you expect someone to have experience with at 1-2 years in? My manager's going to be asking me to set goals for the year, and in the past year I've only done moderated and unmoderated interviews (all for usability testing the product or a prototype).

3204,2022-01-12T13:48:46.670000+00:00,That‚Äôs true. I figured making a journey map would make sense because then I could take the pain points that they experience and zoom out to understand the issues at hand on a broader level. So basically empathising with them a bit more during different steps. Then the next step would be to explore solutions that fit within our structure while using the journey map as a reference.
3205,2022-01-12T11:28:50.090000+00:00,"This would essentially be going against what Prototype is recommending in ‚Äúdon‚Äôt advise using pain points as the basis‚Äù because like he said, some of these pain points may not deal with the primary flow at all"
3206,2022-01-12T11:21:25.977000+00:00,I would read and learn more about when to use them which will help you clear it up
3207,2022-01-12T11:21:10.746000+00:00,Those are 3 separate tools that focus on 3 separate functions
3208,2022-01-11T11:00:27.768000+00:00,"Another thought that came to my mind was creating a journey map instead of the prioritization matrix to understand what issues the users have at different stages. However, I'm not sure how much that would differ from an affinity map that I have already. I guess it could be a way to look at the points on a more macro level."
3209,2022-01-10T22:35:35.728000+00:00,"Thanks, I was thinking about prioritisation matrix too. So for example if I pick out common themes from all those pain points that they listed and generate a bunch of HMWs/opportunities to test out further, would that be a solid approach?"
3210,2022-01-10T22:25:09.322000+00:00,you're going to end up with a design focused on removing those pain points in abstract of whether the design is the best design for the job
3211,2022-01-10T22:24:44.533000+00:00,I'm not sure I would use pain points as the basis for a redesign though.
3212,2022-01-10T22:23:35.783000+00:00,prioritization matrix first
3213,2022-01-10T21:29:39.451000+00:00,Also I must note that I joined the project during the private beta phase so my task is to redesign the platform and I already have insights from the usability test.
3214,2022-01-10T21:13:56.747000+00:00,"Hey guys, I need some help. Currently, I'm synthesizing the private beta test results for a marketplace.

Ideally it would be from a UX research perspective but standard teaching is fine too. If you have a more global UX quantitative methodology go-to resource, let me know I could also be interested. Thanks!"

3247,2021-12-20T01:22:37.064000+00:00,"To add on, a bit late though. My company has recently used two agencies for full recruitment and have had very little problems (minus some participants no-showing/being late, but to no fault of the recruiters). ThinkGroup, which is Austin, TX based, perfect for Texas recruitment, but also works wonderful for US-nationwide https://thinkgroupaustin.com/services/ We also use Adler-Weiner for 80%+ of our national recruitment for large tech clients https://adlerweiner.com/

Typically expect ~$100 to ~$125 per participant for nationwide recruits with *some* specifics (i.e., Current rider of X public transportation agency. Current user of X, Y, Z social media platforms and is also an admin or moderator of groups/subreddits). Obviously more constraints/specifics the more expensive recruitment is too. So typically comes out to ~$1100-$1500 for 7 recruits, seating 5 participants.

Typically one or two hour calls to figure out specifics and screener, and then $200-350 Project management fee, and then we have our 5-7 participants in about 2 weeks. Easiest recruitment of my UXR experience hah. Obviously more expensive than sourcing and searching by the UXRs"

3281,2021-12-14T18:14:46.111000+00:00,"and get the work they paid for, done"
3282,2021-12-14T18:14:36.695000+00:00,you need to figure it out
3283,2021-12-14T18:14:32.517000+00:00,details do not matter to them whether a participant no shows
3284,2021-12-14T18:14:24.001000+00:00,Clients are clients. They are paying YOU/company to get it done right
3285,2021-12-14T18:13:52.831000+00:00,"Find out who needs to take ownership, you or your manager"
3286,2021-12-14T18:13:41.772000+00:00,Right and that is up to ownership
3287,2021-12-14T18:13:28.298000+00:00,"Yeah, it's usually the client paying for the recruitment cost here, so our main issue is angry clients when it goes wrong"
3288,2021-12-14T18:12:04.259000+00:00,"If I'm paying $300 or something for PM work, I am going to make them do $300 worth of work"
3289,2021-12-14T18:11:57.947000+00:00,I'm curious about what the steps are
3290,2021-12-14T18:11:39.085000+00:00,But the floaters need to sit ready for a specific amount of hours
3291,2021-12-14T18:11:37.603000+00:00,My participant show up rate is about 99% now but it is because i've asked project managers explicitly steps they need to do for me
3292,2021-12-14T18:11:19.151000+00:00,Technical issues are usually the culprit though
3293,2021-12-14T18:11:09.048000+00:00,"so 8 users, 2 floaters, 6 testers"
3294,2021-12-14T18:11:05.176000+00:00,one hundo not true for me at this point but in the beginning I used to think that too
3295,2021-12-14T18:11:00.595000+00:00,"Yeah, we usually use 2 floaters for that reason"
3296,2021-12-14T18:10:46.107000+00:00,"it'll happen, even with using a recruiting agency"
3297,2021-12-14T18:10:34.149000+00:00,"""They're not providing you necessary information? what information are you needing?"""
3298,2021-12-14T18:10:24.227000+00:00,I feel like sitting around for no-shows is just the reality of UX Research
3299,2021-12-14T18:10:11.388000+00:00,"If your manager sees a problem in your experience they will 100% go ""Oh you've been having a lot of missed interviews? tell me how many times this has happened"""
3300,2021-12-14T18:09:40.607000+00:00,So that I have to do nothing beside wait till the users call in (and oversee recruitment profiles)
3301,2021-12-14T18:09:40.171000+00:00,I don't know how your hierarchy is so bring it up to your manager and be open and have questions about expectations and process rather than telling the manager that they need to fix this.
3302,2021-12-14T18:09:28.701000+00:00,"At least, that's what we're paying for"
3303,2021-12-14T18:09:10.544000+00:00,"yeah, managing that is part of the recruitment agencies job though!"
3304,2021-12-14T18:08:48.321000+00:00,"If participants aren't showing up, again, I would be annoyed as a manager because my researcher is not being utilized effectively and wasting time (not their choice/fault) sitting around."
3305,2021-12-14T18:07:41.283000+00:00,So bring it up directly with your manager and clarify what you should be expecting
3306,2021-12-14T18:07:37.028000+00:00,"Yeah, also project management, so that each user can show up at for example, 9AM > 10 AM > 11 AM etc"
3307,2021-12-14T18:07:25.626000+00:00,"If they didn't I'd be very direct with them about my expectations and if they have a problem with this we need to chat. Again, I think I have that ability to do so vs a new researcher in the org."
3308,2021-12-14T18:07:08.236000+00:00,"Well usually when we get respondents from profiles with the current services you can see their names, contacts details, age, and any defined characteristics. Which I can than look at and call them if it isn't a good mix for example. 

What is also often a problem is that when a user doesn't show up, it's important they're easily contactable"
3309,2021-12-14T18:06:23.277000+00:00,They should be doing work that I am paying them for which is project management.
3310,2021-12-14T18:06:21.903000+00:00,that has been my experience as well
3311,2021-12-14T18:05:53.134000+00:00,The agencies here send me a schedule with all the information in one sheet. I literally do nothing in terms of recruitment other than provide target and screener and the times/dates available.
3312,2021-12-14T18:04:29.699000+00:00,"UserTesting pricing I think is similar to UI but I think UI has been easier for my own recruitments personally. No project management person but I've found the screeners and support people pretty responsive and easy to be like ""yo this person didn't fit my requirements can I get a different person"""
3313,2021-12-14T18:02:39.314000+00:00,The project management fee is literally for you to NOT do any coordination or recruitment etc
3314,2021-12-14T18:02:08.555000+00:00,Which I also recognize isn't your responsibility/role it is your manager or even above at the director level.
3315,2021-12-14T18:01:41.020000+00:00,Yeah you need to negotiate with the sales person and project manager better if they're not doing it properly
3316,2021-12-14T18:01:30.683000+00:00,WDYM?
3317,2021-12-14T18:00:44.841000+00:00,Lot of recruitment agencies do a lot of half work
3318,2021-12-14T17:59:55.975000+00:00,"I guess it also depends on their service, being able to show all participants contact details, and how they act when things go very wrong"
3319,2021-12-14T17:57:38.934000+00:00,and i'm misremembering
3320,2021-12-14T17:57:32.237000+00:00,unless they dont do it per participant
3321,2021-12-14T17:57:10.749000+00:00,per participant?
3322,2021-12-14T17:57:04.879000+00:00,"for contrast, I think usertesting.com is $50"
3323,2021-12-14T17:55:03.131000+00:00,recruitment requirements can sway that $40 to like $250 or something depending on the speciality and specificity
3324,2021-12-14T17:54:26.902000+00:00,Depends on your type of recruitment but for user interviews just commoner participant it is like incentive + $40 bucks per participant
3325,2021-12-14T17:54:13.636000+00:00,but thats with compensation built in
3326,2021-12-14T17:53:46.510000+00:00,150-250 per participant
3327,2021-12-14T17:53:42.411000+00:00,sounds about right
3328,2021-12-14T17:49:52.416000+00:00,Currently it‚Äôs like 1100 euro for the alternatives
3329,2021-12-14T17:48:57.475000+00:00,"How expensive is expensive for lets say: 6 users, including pm costs and specialized profiles etc?"
3330,2021-12-14T17:01:45.415000+00:00,who probably farm it out to other agencies
3331,2021-12-14T17:01:39.284000+00:00,and large companies just farm it out to agencies
3332,2021-12-14T17:01:32.525000+00:00,imo most small companies just use whatever is built into their testing platform
3333,2021-12-14T16:58:27.391000+00:00,"in my city, there are maybe 5-6 larger /UX/ consultancies that offer recruitment as one of their services"
3334,2021-12-14T16:04:22.520000+00:00,I am pretty sure UT is way too expensive though. The last time I chatted with sales my eyes went üëÄ and then UI was the one the startups I freelance or work with have gone with
3335,2021-12-14T16:03:06.104000+00:00,Respondent and User Testing works as well
3336,2021-12-14T16:02:09.423000+00:00,Then there's private recruitment firms but I don't think I can name them

I was thinking exit rate or time on page? I'm struggling a bit with this one because it isn't as simple as measuring clicks."

You are talking about Mobile Apps (outside of gaming) downloads being more popular on website than an app store? On a mobile device?

Or are you talking about both Mobile downloads and Desktop downloads?

And I can't speak for Proto but I think he's saying that 40% of mobile app store downloads are gaming and 60% is not gaming but that in the 60% there are a lot of diverse categories that make up the 60%."

3380,2021-12-08T12:24:02.772000+00:00,So unless your app is part of that  group that strategy of not being for a niche user is pretty weak
3381,2021-12-08T12:20:09.684000+00:00,"Add TikTok, instagram and whatever other most popular apps to this, then still less than 0.001% of apps contribute to that number"

3383,2021-12-08T12:15:16.437000+00:00,Because just WhatsApp already contributes for 5 billion downloads
3384,2021-12-08T12:11:21.860000+00:00,Then how many % of apps contribute to that number?
3385,2021-12-08T11:41:38.901000+00:00,"Yeah, I'm going to need you to support this claim. 2020 had like 150billion downloads directly from the app store (google or apple) where less than half were games"

3402,2021-12-06T18:45:37.228000+00:00,"Process will greatly depend on the project too. Which point are starting from? (as in, does a product already exist?)"
3403,2021-12-06T18:27:52.620000+00:00,Thanks - I see where you‚Äôre coming from. Research is the most time consuming part of the process for me so far

3409,2021-12-06T09:23:45.410000+00:00,So wasting time can be a problem there. But if for your own case study that's always good.
3410,2021-12-06T09:23:11.012000+00:00,But don't expect that just because you find 'facts' client will perceive them as facts. You're just one of the many sources of evidence.
3411,2021-12-06T09:22:29.694000+00:00,"If you want to do more, you can always do more!"
3412,2021-12-06T09:21:59.009000+00:00,"Yeah I suppose it really depends. Can get costly, just the recruitment of a simple concept test is +1000 euro"
3413,2021-12-06T09:21:28.246000+00:00,"As a consultant you can always give advice, but it's still on them I suppose."
3414,2021-12-06T09:21:03.209000+00:00,That's very true haha. I guess I just try to approach every project from a solid UX perspective so even if its outside the scope I want to make it look nice for a case study.
3415,2021-12-06T09:20:50.933000+00:00,"We've had to test products that were a total mess many times. But if they just want to know the usability, you need to present just that."
3416,2021-12-06T09:20:18.868000+00:00,But it really depends on the context of the project I suppose.
3417,2021-12-06T09:18:46.162000+00:00,"Depends on the question and budget of the client, as client pays for a set amount of time. You can of course discuss this before starting. Problem is that even if you find out that the product features are not a great product market fit, doesn't mean they're going to listen to you."
3418,2021-12-06T09:07:08.665000+00:00,"By the way, since we're at it. I have one last question. For example, when you're working with a client and you're given a task to design some kind of product where the features are already outlined. Is it still best to perform research to figure out whether those features are the right ones or if they could be improved?"
3419,2021-12-06T09:02:34.937000+00:00,No doubt. I think it's just a matter of finding those people. Maybe one of the ways to do it is by going to places where they talk about these things and reaching out.
3420,2021-12-06T09:01:09.307000+00:00,"Which is one of those things why talking to people can be useful. Because deskresearch can only give you insight in what you're looking at, people can surprise you with things that weren't in your scope but still very valuable."
3421,2021-12-06T08:59:03.919000+00:00,And especially things like DAO can be very political.
3422,2021-12-06T08:57:23.597000+00:00,"So doing research about common problems in the US, will probably not translate to your own country."
3423,2021-12-06T08:56:28.118000+00:00,"Maybe also depends on the area, but for example, in the US you still need to physically go to the bank for some things. While the banks in the NL are currently fully digital and the need for a physical bank is gone."
3424,2021-12-06T08:55:17.614000+00:00,"Yeah, don't forget that country specific things can be quite different though. Like in banking, the US is really 10 - 20 years behind, compared to some countries in the EU."
3425,2021-12-06T08:51:55.982000+00:00,"Yeah, that's what I was thinking. I'm gonna look into secondary sources like online discussions, industry reports, data, etc. and use that to define the problem as well as potential opportunities."
3426,2021-12-06T08:50:39.202000+00:00,Never assume someone haven't asked the questions you ask before! üòõ
3427,2021-12-06T08:47:52.813000+00:00,"Yeah, eventually you want to do user research. But you can do a lot of things with other methods too. Especially around DAO, there's also tons of research done. So you can use that all in preparation of your prototype. Especially with all the forums around about decentralization, think of online ethnographic research"
3428,2021-12-06T08:31:47.247000+00:00,Awesome! I am currently building a DAO platform for a community so these methods will be super useful. I already researched common features for these type of platforms so most likely I will do trend analysis as well. Quite difficult to do direct user research in this case so I‚Äôm thinking on getting more insights from prototype testing along the way.
3429,2021-12-06T08:27:07.320000+00:00,"However, you don't have to actually analyse the market as in key revenue streams etc, but more regarding the product side."
3430,2021-12-06T08:25:54.441000+00:00,"Part of this is Market Research though, not necessarily UX research (though can be partly)"
3431,2021-12-06T08:25:13.162000+00:00,"Yeah, this is all part of discovery I suppose. Especially these specific methods."
3432,2021-12-06T08:23:58.983000+00:00,Great advice! I assume this is done in the initial discovery phase?

3442,2021-12-06T08:15:34.101000+00:00,To do this you could do DESTEP analysis
3443,2021-12-06T08:14:58.944000+00:00,"Also, decentralization is a trend. So you could do some minor trend research for this."
3444,2021-12-06T08:11:44.103000+00:00,"Basically you want to find out whether there is a 'need' for a decentralized app, which could be a bit of market research I suppose.

3449,2021-12-05T10:00:12.955000+00:00,We also do US clients sometimes. So in theory you could look at agencies all around the globe.
3450,2021-12-05T00:50:09.060000+00:00,Thanks!! I'll look into those companies!
3451,2021-12-05T00:45:14.660000+00:00,"Often times you can look for Design studios or ""Consultancies"" - they might offer more services than just UXR, but will often UXR's to carry out those portions of the projects + UXR specific projects (I work at one in Seattle WA - Anthro-Tech; major/national ones might include frog, Fjord, Work and Co, Blink, Ideo, User Research International, etc)"
3452,2021-12-03T18:11:59.552000+00:00,"You can always hire <@!419168292041785345>, he does some UXR freelance"
3453,2021-12-03T16:28:55.756000+00:00,"Thanks anyway üòä I've heard good things about usertesting having user researchers to do research projects with companies on the side, but was just wondering there are other good ones so I can compare and evaluate"

3458,2021-12-03T04:26:21.301000+00:00,Anyone has any good recommendations for user research agencies??
3459,2021-12-02T04:01:13.884000+00:00,<@!232781162785931265> interesting thought - my interpretation is that the her product is not defined yet?
3460,2021-11-30T13:43:46.530000+00:00,"I propose that the right mindset here is ""why will our product likely fail?"" and thereafter ""what can I do *now* to prevent that future"". If you're not sure why your product will fail, the first step is pure competitor analysis: why did competitors succeed/fail, and where's your room for improvement."
3461,2021-11-30T06:22:17.142000+00:00,Then from there you can iterate
3462,2021-11-30T06:21:02.547000+00:00,The easiest way to construct a research question(s) is to write down goals and turn those goals into questions
3463,2021-11-30T06:11:22.282000+00:00,What are the goals of the research?
3464,2021-11-30T02:45:09.156000+00:00,"Hi! I am working on my Research Plan and am having a hard time figuring out what my research questions should be.

3466,2021-11-29T12:23:24.903000+00:00,"No worries, if you're finished feel free to share you questions in a google docs"
3467,2021-11-29T12:19:57.110000+00:00,Then I'll start right now. thanks a lot for helpingüòá
3468,2021-11-29T12:16:57.405000+00:00,"Your second and third goal don't need that many questions, as they're quite specific."
3469,2021-11-29T12:13:48.590000+00:00,And follow up questions per question
3470,2021-11-29T12:13:09.051000+00:00,With using the different stages as headings
3471,2021-11-29T12:12:31.267000+00:00,"So for each of these stages, think of multiple questions. Use a google docs, with 11 PT as your text size, and don't stop till you have at least 1 page full with questions answering just your first goal."
3472,2021-11-29T12:08:54.186000+00:00,"You want to know where they were when purchasing, what device they used, who they discussed it with, what time of day it was, how much time it took."
3473,2021-11-29T12:06:54.315000+00:00,"See yourself as a detective, there's a case and you want to know every little detail that will give you insights."
3474,2021-11-29T12:06:18.384000+00:00,This way you can specify questions based on very specific steps
3475,2021-11-29T12:03:41.738000+00:00,"Suggestion is: 

Turn goal into questions; which will be your research question. Think about sub questions, based on these questions.

Work on the questions in the template of a journey of buying an item. So set of questions of a process where someone is **passively looking**. WHich is the behaviour where someone is looking for products, but no intention to buy. This process can take months often, for example, I've been passively looking at classical guitars for the last 6 months, but it will still be some time before I actually buy one. **Active looking**, which is usually caused by some 'event' which triggered the need for actually buying the product (like my guitar breaking). **Deciding**, which is where the questions are regarding the product features, needs, values and based on which influences a person makes the decision. Then **Buying** which is the actual moment of purchase, just the general purchase flow. And lastly **Post-purchase**, which is the moment of giving reviews of products, sharing it on socialmedia, being either happy or angry with the product and how this translates to behaviour."
3476,2021-11-29T11:45:36.729000+00:00,Now is your suggestion to work on the questions and write the script or rewrite the goals?
3477,2021-11-29T11:38:57.261000+00:00,"But also to avoid closed or leading questions, because that's difficult to not do if you're asking things on the spot"
3478,2021-11-29T11:38:25.481000+00:00,of course
3479,2021-11-29T11:37:56.710000+00:00,"Remember the interview guide is just to be there as a memory check, to keep structure, you don't have to follow it like some manual."
3480,2021-11-29T11:37:14.030000+00:00,That's in the interview guide
3481,2021-11-29T11:36:58.435000+00:00,Basically; specific small but open questions yeah.
3482,2021-11-29T11:36:30.703000+00:00,"I guess that's also the difficult part of an interview, as it is basically an interrogation, but the moment if feels like an interrogation people will talk less. So it's kind of making small specific questions, however, still be natural in the way you converse."
3483,2021-11-29T11:35:35.835000+00:00,So I have to break this question down into a few small specific questions?
3484,2021-11-29T11:31:39.356000+00:00,"And also be able to say ""I need to stop you, because we got limited time"""
3485,2021-11-29T11:31:13.124000+00:00,"You as a moderator of the interview wants to control the conversation, so you need to be very specific at times, and avoid being vague like ""Tell me about last time"" but rather do in in different steps ""What was the last time""  > ""what did you buy"" > Where did you buy"" > ""Why there"" > ect etc"
3486,2021-11-29T11:30:15.523000+00:00,You often got two type of extreme users in an interview. One talks to little and one talks too much.
3487,2021-11-29T11:29:14.156000+00:00,Which is 15 minutes wasted on things you might not even want to know.
3488,2021-11-29T11:29:12.507000+00:00,i see
3489,2021-11-29T11:28:55.275000+00:00,Because the other side is that they might tell you 15 minutes about how they had a very bad experience with the costumer support on the phone.
3490,2021-11-29T11:28:29.605000+00:00,That's the part you need to control
3491,2021-11-29T11:28:17.263000+00:00,What do you need me to be telling about?
3492,2021-11-29T11:27:59.283000+00:00,"""Well, it had a nice color I think."""
3493,2021-11-29T11:27:46.512000+00:00,"Then you say ""Can you tell me about that?"""
3494,2021-11-29T11:27:19.447000+00:00,"Well you want to avoid ""Yes, last time I bought a chair. At [shop] I think. (conversation over)"""
3495,2021-11-29T11:26:31.676000+00:00,"and here and there, I ask to tell about the last case when the user visited and bought furniture"
3496,2021-11-29T11:25:23.262000+00:00,"The main question in the volume is what is the difference between ""Remember the last time you chose and bought furniture online? Tell us about this case"" and ""How often do you shop for furniture online? Can you tell me about the last time?"""
3497,2021-11-29T11:25:03.166000+00:00,"Ahh, I see."
3498,2021-11-29T11:24:52.186000+00:00,I made a mistake adding the question - Can you tell me something about yourself?
3499,2021-11-29T11:22:19.811000+00:00,"So basically, before getting very specific and start digging you want to spent like 5 minutes just building rapport."
3500,2021-11-29T11:19:27.012000+00:00,"You don't do that by:
- Name?
- Age?
- State of work?
- State of marriage"
3501,2021-11-29T11:18:45.003000+00:00,"Before you can dig and probe for information you need to ensure the other person knows you're human too. Because if they feel at ease and trust you, they will open up to you."
3502,2021-11-29T11:17:16.216000+00:00,"the ""Can you tell me about yourself"" is a question to build rapport, here you don't want to be too specific. Because the function of this question is to build a rapport, you don't really need to know this information. You just want to loosen up the conversation."
3503,2021-11-29T11:15:06.016000+00:00,"The difference is that you don't specify your question and lacks structure. 
- You're allowing freedom how this question can be answered, therefore they get to choose which parts they will tell you, even though not all answers will be relevant for you.
- Because they can answer whatever they want, different people will talk about different moments they remember, giving you breadth instead of depth. 
- Memory works in association, that's why it's also important to be specific. You questioning/probing also has a function of bringing back associations. Because it's very likely important moments aren't being remembered. 
- If you will be getting a very short answer, you will be missing a lot."
3504,2021-11-29T11:01:19.114000+00:00,"and here and there, we ask to remember the last time a person was in the Internet shop and ask to remember his experience"
3505,2021-11-29T11:00:16.890000+00:00,"I have a question
   ""Remember the last time you chose and bought furniture online? Tell us about this case.""
  You write that this question ""could contain many questions, you want to define exactly what you want to know about that last time.""
But also you write ""Intro
- Can you tell me something about yourself?

- How often do you shop for furniture online?
     - Can you tell me about the last time? ""
What's the difference between ""Remember the last time you chose and bought furniture online? Tell us about this case"" and ""How often do you shop for furniture online? Can you tell me about the last time?"""
3506,2021-11-29T10:59:56.459000+00:00,understood
3507,2021-11-29T10:57:45.948000+00:00,But currently I think this might overcomplicate thing; it's better to just dive into consumer behaviour and what such a journey contains. Which is much more valuable for your specific goals.
3508,2021-11-29T10:56:00.142000+00:00,"But if you're not interested in designing such a value based product, it's not that important to research. Maybe if you want some kind of all sustainable green furniture shop."
3509,2021-11-29T10:54:37.173000+00:00,"Or DuckDuck Go, who's all into value data privacy (security)"
3510,2021-11-29T10:53:21.164000+00:00,Only then value analysis becomes very interesting
3511,2021-11-29T10:53:03.152000+00:00,"Which in design translates to showing off with your amount of KM you cycled, keeping progress, etc"
3512,2021-11-29T10:52:05.042000+00:00,"Like Strava is entirely based on the value ""Achievement"""
3513,2021-11-29T10:51:33.879000+00:00,You often see it in product design
3514,2021-11-29T10:50:20.853000+00:00,Thinking about it now will not help with your current research goals
3515,2021-11-29T10:48:41.043000+00:00,"Useful in terms of analyzing data you collect, not as a datapoint itself."
3516,2021-11-29T10:47:03.957000+00:00,"How useful is it to take advantage of existing data on values, and is it publicly available at all?"
3517,2021-11-29T10:46:23.214000+00:00,And reasoning is usually connected to values
3518,2021-11-29T10:45:51.353000+00:00,"So it's good to know how they function as in; they can be seen as weights, but that's all you need to know."

3522,2021-11-29T10:44:07.682000+00:00,And get paid by some university to write papers
3523,2021-11-29T10:43:46.006000+00:00,Unless you're writing a big white paper
3524,2021-11-29T10:43:32.738000+00:00,Which honestly is a waste of time

3528,2021-11-29T10:38:23.319000+00:00,Rating values by importance is done with laddering technique
3529,2021-11-29T10:37:05.230000+00:00,"```
(3) Values transcend specific actions and situations. Obedience and honesty values,
for example, may be relevant in the workplace or school, in business or politics, with
friends or strangers. This feature distinguishes values from norms and attitudes that
usually refer to specific actions, objects, or situations.

(4) Values serve as standards or criteria. Values guide the selection or evaluation of
actions, policies, people, and events. People decide what is good or bad, justified or
illegitimate, worth doing or avoiding, based on possible consequences for their
cherished values. But the impact of values in everyday decisions is rarely conscious.
Values enter awareness when the actions or judgments one is considering have
conflicting implications for different values one cherishes.

(5) Values are ordered by importance relative to one another. People‚Äôs values form an
ordered system of priorities that characterize them as individuals. Do they attribute
more importance to achievement or justice, to novelty or tradition? This hierarchical
feature also distinguishes values from norms and attitudes.

(6) The relative importance of multiple values guides action. Any attitude or behavior
typically has implications for more than one value. For example, attending church
might express and promote tradition and conformity values at the expense of hedonism
and stimulation values. The tradeoff among relevant, competing values guides
attitudes and behaviors (Schwartz, 1992, 1996). Values influence action when they are
relevant in the context (hence likely to be activated) and important to the actor. ```"
3530,2021-11-29T10:35:46.330000+00:00,To quote the most important line from that article:
3531,2021-11-29T10:35:41.430000+00:00,Yeah)
3532,2021-11-29T10:35:20.054000+00:00,But that might not be a thing you want to focus on with your first few interviews.
3533,2021-11-29T10:35:01.077000+00:00,https://scholarworks.gvsu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1116&context=orpc
3534,2021-11-29T10:34:59.942000+00:00,Here's some theory about that
3535,2021-11-29T10:34:07.371000+00:00,"The most basic forms is that you give option A and B of two contrasting values, and see which one appeals to them more."
3536,2021-11-29T10:32:50.582000+00:00,"There's laddering analysis. But that's a whole new technique in itself, so may be complex to do 10 new things at once."
3537,2021-11-29T10:32:04.768000+00:00,very interesting. Are there any ways to evaluate what is more valuable for the user?
3538,2021-11-29T10:31:46.227000+00:00,"Yeah, bit of both, but the value is never in a direct answer. It's always sort of mushed in a bush of weeds."
3539,2021-11-29T10:30:00.762000+00:00,"So I care about data privacy if it's literally giving me nothing in return, but if I get a cookie I'm convinced."
3540,2021-11-29T10:29:17.890000+00:00,"So then there are two contrasting values *Data Privacy* and *Ease of Use*, however values are like 'weights' so people can care about the same thing, even though it contrasts, but sometimes one weighs out the other, and knowing what weighs heavy is valuabl.e"
3541,2021-11-29T10:28:21.562000+00:00,"now I understand, just before I thought that it only concerns questions about emotions, but I didn‚Äôt think that it also concerns their reasons"
3542,2021-11-29T10:26:51.408000+00:00,"That's why it's always good to ask about reasoning (of the same subject) in different parts in the interview, because you may find out there are contrasting reasons given. Like someone will say ""I don't like that they're collecting data of me!"" then later in the interview they might say ""Yeah I logged in with Facebook because that was easy"" even though they didn't really mind checking the box *Share information with Facebook*"
3543,2021-11-29T10:24:16.819000+00:00,"What's more interesting is the emotions behind the reasoning, but you never take the reason at face value."
3544,2021-11-29T10:22:20.454000+00:00,"Because people often don't know the reasons behind their actions, so they'll make up something on the spot"
3545,2021-11-29T10:20:39.222000+00:00,you said that asking for reasons doesn't work well. Why can't I ask about reasons?
3546,2021-11-29T09:43:34.264000+00:00,"I happen to be doing analysis this week for different furniture shops, so that's quite a coincidence"
3547,2021-11-29T09:40:36.455000+00:00,For your questioning about behaviour of choosing products
3548,2021-11-29T09:40:17.210000+00:00,Also take some inspiration from: https://www.nngroup.com/articles/information-foraging/
3549,2021-11-29T09:02:01.404000+00:00,"So for you general structure template you could use:

**Research Questions** (where each of your goals are turned into questions, with at least three sub questions under it). The questions you ask in the different steps can aim to answer these questions. They also act as a compass for where to ask follow up questions and where not.

**Intro**
This part contains building a rapport with people. Be careful, you don't want this to be a set of questions, but rather a conversation to get to know the person in front of you. You then follow up with the questions in goal 2 and 3.

**Journey**

Here you ask questions of goal 1. Do some research of the steps of an online purchase, structure your questions that way. This has two benefits. One is that you get very specific information about very specific parts in the journey. Two; when analyzing the research you have the entire journey in structure already. 

**End**
Here you can ask whether you've missed something. like steps, etc."
3550,2021-11-29T08:56:04.357000+00:00,"Currently your current questions are too shallow, because they lack specificity. 

‚Ä¢ Remember the last time you chose and bought furniture online? Tell us about this case.

Just this question could contain many questions, you want to define exactly what you want to know about that last time. 

‚Ä¢ Tell us what steps did you take to choose and buy furniture?

Steps consumers take are already researched. Rather than which steps people take, you want to know how they handle such a specific step. For example, when comparing products, what are they comparing? what are they most sensitive to? What helps them compare? What are issues when comparing? Do they show it to friends? How much does that opinion weight?

relevant article: https://www.nngroup.com/articles/the-3cs-of-critical-web-use-collect-compare-choose/

‚Ä¢ What did you pay attention to when choosing furniture?

This you could already have covered by going through the steps, but is a good question.

‚Ä¢ From 1 to 5 (where 1 is very bad and 5 is very good) how was the selection and registration of buying 

This question can also be good, but only if you ask them to clarify the reasoning after they gave a rating. The rating itself isn't important, it's just a way of probing."
3551,2021-11-29T08:48:29.526000+00:00,"However, also keep in mind, an interview guide isn't so that you can exactly ask what you see at the questions. The interview guide is just acting as a checkbox, to ensure you covered all subjects you wanted to ask. You always want to ask follow up questions that are based on the answers of the participants"
3552,2021-11-29T08:46:45.545000+00:00,On paper just the costumer journey part can easily be 2 pages
3553,2021-11-29T08:46:24.701000+00:00,"Then for the

**Customer Journey** or goal 1 you can just take a general structure of a journey like:

**[Passive looking]**
- questions about passive looking (example: What was the trigger this person started looking? How does a person browse? What websites came up?)
**[Active looking]**
- Questions about active looking (example:What was the trigger this person started looking for real? Was there any plan in mind? (budget))
**[Deciding]**
- Questions about how one decides between different products (for example your question: What did you pay attention to when choosing furniture? Which store did they choose and why?)
**[Purchase]**
- Questions regarding the purchase flow
**[Satisfaction]**
- Questions regarding the post purchase flow (maybe costumer support, sharing pictures with everyone, whatever)"

3555,2021-11-29T08:39:32.429000+00:00,"I guess on a first note, your formulation of a problem doesn‚Äôt really contain a problem, it contains what you want to learn. Or ‚Äòthe goal of the research‚Äô

One useful thing you could do based on the goals, is turning the goals into research questions. ‚ÄúSo Find out why users shop for furniture online.‚Äù could be framed as a question; ‚ÄúWhy do users shop online for furniture?‚Äù as an example. You can then also think of sub questions, to further specify. This will help your question. Like ‚ÄúWhat are the pros and cons of shopping online?‚Äù

Based on your goals, it looks like you'd gain a lot by researching the customer journey. That doesn't mean you need to make one, you just research based on the different stages of a customer journey.

You could start with an introduction where you touch goal 2 and 3: **shopping online**

Currently you got `Was there a specific reason to buy furniture online?  If so, which one?` which isn't a great question, because directly asking for reasons doesn't work well. You could instead try multiple questions here, for example:

**Intro**
- Can you tell me something about yourself? 

- How often do you shop for furniture online?
    - Can you tell me about the last time?
    - Why did you buy that online?
          - Do you always buy your furniture online?
          - In which context wouldn't you buy furniture online?
          - In which context would you?
    - Which shop did you buy the furniture?
          - Why that one?
etc... (just some examples)"

Let me introduce myself, my name is Matvey, I am working on an educational project for an online furniture store. I am currently doing research that will help me better understand users, their motivations and problem points. The interview will take place in 3 stages: first I will ask you to tell about yourself, then I will ask questions about the product and then you can clarify something, ask or add something. There is no right or wrong answer to the questions, so do not worry that you will answer incorrectly. I also want to note that if you are not comfortable answering a question, you can skip it. If you want to ask something now, then please. If that's all, then let's get started.

Let's talk about you:
What is your name?
How old are you?
What is your current employment status?
Please tell us about your usual day

Great, now let's move on to the product questions:

(1 - Reveal the thought processes of users and previous experiences with buying furniture online.):
‚Ä¢ Remember the last time you chose and bought furniture online? Tell us about this case.
‚Ä¢ Tell us what steps did you take to choose and buy furniture?
‚Ä¢ What did you pay attention to when choosing furniture?
‚Ä¢ From 1 to 5 (where 1 is very bad and 5 is very good) how was the selection and registration of buying furniture online? Tell us why such a rating? If your assessment is related to a problem, what was the problem and what did you do when you encountered it?

(2 - Find out why users shop online for furniture)
‚Ä¢ Was there a specific reason to buy furniture online? If so, which one?

(3 - Find out in which online stores users usually choose furniture and what they think of each of them.)
‚Ä¢ Tell us about the online stores where you usually order furniture?
‚Ä¢ What are their advantages and disadvantages? If you have several online stores where you order, can you compare them?
‚Ä¢ What factors do you pay more attention to when choosing an online furniture store?"
3560,2021-11-29T07:59:13.018000+00:00,"Hi, if I understand correctly, I need to make an interview plan. If so, here's what I did. There is a problem: in the second section where the goal is to find out why users buy furniture online, I managed to come up with only 1 question. Is this enough to achieve the goal or do you need to come up with a couple more? if necessary, could you please suggest some examples or templates. And what do you generally think about the script and the questions?"
3561,2021-11-28T10:54:17.073000+00:00,Then maybe talk tomorrow
3562,2021-11-28T10:25:38.838000+00:00,"It‚Äôs a bit of a complex question to answer on my sunday morning.

The goals are quite clear, which is good. The thing you want to do now is create a plan of action, for each of those three goals. In which it would be useful to create a interview script. Where each goal will be 1 section and each section will only contain questions for that specific goal.

To help you with this I‚Äôd need to be behind a laptop (which will probably be tomorrow) so I can maybe provide some suggestions for a template of such a script based on these goals, sort of the research strategy."

I set a research goal and worked out questions.  It would be interesting to hear your opinion on these issues and goals, and how they can be improved.  English is not my native language, so if any question sounds strange then I will try to explain what I mean.

Formulation of the problem:

 An assessment of how people make a furniture purchase decision.

 What I want to learn and what results I want to achieve at the end of the study:

 I want to know what factors influence the decision to purchase furniture in order to improve this process and increase its efficiency.

 Goals:

 1) Reveal the thought processes of users and previous experiences with buying furniture online.

 2) Find out why users shop for furniture online.

 3) Find out in which online stores users usually choose furniture and what they think of each of them.

 Questions:

 1) Remember the last time you chose and bought furniture online?  Tell us about this case.

 2) What did you pay attention to when choosing furniture?

 3) Was there a specific reason to buy furniture online?  If so, which one?

3566,2021-11-27T11:35:42.227000+00:00,I wonder which principles apply to inspiration though

3574,2021-11-25T21:03:20.561000+00:00,One of the main differences from all these other forms is that it isn‚Äôt really academic. As the incentive isn‚Äôt to conclude a neutral view but make an actionable recommendation.
3575,2021-11-25T21:01:25.543000+00:00,"I suppose one could say it‚Äôs a subset of behavioral research.

I once read a quote that stated ‚ÄúUXR is researching animal behavior‚Äù which is quite interesting"
3576,2021-11-25T18:05:18.894000+00:00,Design Research does study the past to inform the future.
3577,2021-11-25T18:03:27.395000+00:00,Psychology is a science.
3578,2021-11-25T18:02:59.018000+00:00,Science tries to solve for things that are time independent.
3579,2021-11-25T18:00:53.765000+00:00,Human Factors Engineers are the engineers of the design research world.
3580,2021-11-25T17:57:44.301000+00:00,"Creating science experiments need some skills that engineers have, such as applying previously proven scientific and mathematical principles. They have different desired outcomes and problems to solve."
3581,2021-11-25T17:53:01.203000+00:00,I would argue that it is the knowing principles of science and math and using them to create optimized solutions is what makes someone an engineer.
3582,2021-11-25T17:51:46.482000+00:00,"Design researcher is a type of researcher. Same as biomedical researcher, chemistry researcher, and psychology researcher. Engineer is not a type of scientist."
3583,2021-11-25T17:49:51.283000+00:00,"I think of engineering as the application of science and mathematics to create an optimized solution to a problem. I studied Mechanical Engineering for 2.5 years at the beginning of undergrad.
Engineering has been defined by the Engineers Council for Professional Development, in the United States, as the creative application of ‚Äúscientific principles to design or develop structures, machines, apparatus, or manufacturing processes, or works utilizing them singly or in combination; or to construct or operate the same with full cognizance of their design; or to forecast their behavior under specific operating conditions; all as respects an intended function, economics of operation and safety to life and property.‚Äù

3588,2021-11-25T08:31:23.305000+00:00,"The main difference between research and design research is that of ‚Äòtime‚Äô.

Science or psychology attempts to explain an existing or past phenomenon, while design research attempts to research a future state. In that sense it‚Äôs applied research, like engineering is applied science."
3589,2021-11-25T08:28:03.929000+00:00,"However if using more open questions the importance is that questions must be simple and could easily be explained in one sentence, and they very likely know the answer too."
3590,2021-11-25T08:27:03.827000+00:00,"Survey questions can be; 

- Characteristic (Demographic & Technological)
- Behavioral (Technology use, usage, competitive)
- Attitudinal (Satisfaction, preference, desire)"
3591,2021-11-25T08:25:01.218000+00:00,"Interviews open ended questions, surveys closed questions."
3592,2021-11-25T08:24:33.861000+00:00,"Resources you can easily find by Googling for UX research methods.

Difference between surveys and interviews, is that interviewing is often more fit for qualitative research and surveys are more fit for quantitative."

3599,2021-11-24T12:51:34.974000+00:00,"Some E-commerce even lets you shop ""By inspiration"" quite interesting"
3600,2021-11-24T12:34:39.303000+00:00,"I guess there's some nudging like this going on in book recommendations. People 'like you' also read this book, I'm not sure if this counts as a form of inspiration, though according to the definition we just stated it certainly does..."
3601,2021-11-24T10:10:19.118000+00:00,"Oooh, I love this idea! There certainly can be some learning from persuasive design or design for behavior change that could point some direction for either intentional or unintentional. When I'm back on my computer I could look and see if I have any papers available, but there is research for sure into nudging and the sort of ""unconscious motivation"", pushing users to do an action without directly saying to do it: maybe a form of inspiration in this conversation?"
3602,2021-11-24T09:47:49.055000+00:00,"Division between unintentional and intentional inspiration is interesting too. Unintentional seems to be a small trigger or nudge of exploring a certain direction, intentional a means of comparing and remixing ideas. I'm trying to see if I could research it enough to create little inspirational heuristics that can easily be applied to design."
3603,2021-11-24T09:08:30.994000+00:00,"I typically think of inspiration as something you find or discover that informs further thought or action. If I find an art piece I like, I might take it as ""inspirstion"" to find more art like it, to look more into the author, or to even purchase a print. I think the inspiration could be found or discovered unintentionally (coming across a FB group suggestion while scrolling my feed for memes) or intentionally (i am putting together a mood board before starting a drawing project)"

3605,2021-11-23T09:20:37.267000+00:00,"A bit like Pinterest, what is it really doing in objective terms when giving you 'inspiration'?"
3606,2021-11-23T09:18:32.395000+00:00,In that sense a product suggestion would already be 'inspiration'...
3607,2021-11-23T09:18:15.597000+00:00,I was thinking something along the lines of: finding 'something' valuable you weren't looking for
3608,2021-11-23T09:17:20.184000+00:00,How would you guys put a metric on inspiration in analysis?
3609,2021-11-23T06:18:32.009000+00:00,Yeah probably
3610,2021-11-23T03:03:03.303000+00:00,"Yes mainly demographics and also some behaviour/routine questions. We have some research already in place - mainly young adults who are keen on investing with little to no finance background. But we want to dive further within this segment to find the sub-group users to target. Will a quantitative survey work to help define this sub-group?

It is not a good practice to start designing research without having a thorough understanding of business goals&requirements through stakeholder interviews, so why should it be/is it different during the interview process?"
3614,2021-11-22T18:42:39.743000+00:00,I'd reach out to the hiring manager and follow-up with some questions or write out your assumptions and articulate how they shaped your decisions.
3615,2021-11-22T18:33:08.038000+00:00,"Folks shouldn't (and hopefully won't) help you with tasks for job interviews. As a hiring manager I will say that: everything is on the task they've given you. If there's something missing, it's missing for a reason."

3624,2021-11-21T22:18:35.080000+00:00,"Yeah, if you don‚Äôt have any cards to sort than definitely"
3625,2021-11-21T21:55:45.157000+00:00,I would probably just run an open card sort. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
3626,2021-11-21T21:52:24.508000+00:00,"Yeah, it‚Äôs just two modes of thinking."
3627,2021-11-21T21:52:12.290000+00:00,But I agree with Dario about trying to do both at the same time.
3628,2021-11-21T21:52:03.107000+00:00,you dont need to run a card sort to run a tree test.
3629,2021-11-21T21:51:53.170000+00:00,This is one of those IA things that can be hard for people to wrap their heads around though. The absence of someone actively having conducted a card sorting exercise does not mean that someone hasn't already effectively run card sorting by just deciding on what categories and organization things are in
3630,2021-11-21T21:51:06.137000+00:00,It will be a complete mess
3631,2021-11-21T21:50:59.818000+00:00,"Yeah it‚Äôs a bit like building train tracks while exploring the fastest route, if you do both at once."
3632,2021-11-21T21:50:00.711000+00:00,it validates card sorting
3633,2021-11-21T21:49:49.215000+00:00,Yes. Tree testing is reverse card sorting.
3634,2021-11-21T21:47:25.871000+00:00,Usually you start with card sorting; in which you evaluate the mental model. Then validate with tree testing.
3635,2021-11-21T21:46:40.541000+00:00,The draw back is that you mixing two contrasting type of research at the same time.
3636,2021-11-21T16:08:51.520000+00:00,"Hi all, I currently have a situation with 3-4 related pages that desperately need a new home in the website.

I've been reading a lot of articles on card sorting and tree testing and wondering if something between a hybrid card sort and a tree test would be a valid way to test users, since I don't have a lot of cards to sort (or time to test multiple trees) and trying to extend the IA. Basically, users would be presented with the task to find Item X and the existing navigation tree, but they would also able to suggest new categories as they go.

Has anyone experimented with this kind of setup before? Are there any drawbacks I should be aware of?"
3637,2021-11-21T09:53:26.282000+00:00,"Then probably just focus on the wireframes yeah, Research may not be a very important part in your role"
3638,2021-11-21T09:52:55.843000+00:00,"That‚Äôs a requirement for the deliverables (also with design process,flow & wireframe) but what they want to see is how sharp the problem identification, ideas, and how to tell all the process to find solutions"
3639,2021-11-21T09:47:58.479000+00:00,Yes
3640,2021-11-21T09:47:23.095000+00:00,"Ohh, for work?"
3641,2021-11-21T09:47:07.660000+00:00,No tes for UX positions
3642,2021-11-21T09:41:56.460000+00:00,Is this for your school?
3643,2021-11-21T09:41:17.569000+00:00,"Ah, I see‚Ä¶ thanks <@!209640428151111680> 

Actually I only have tomorrow for the deadline‚Ä¶ and I‚Äôm in the process of designing the wireframe. I don‚Äôt think I have enough time üò¶"
3644,2021-11-21T09:36:15.246000+00:00,"So it‚Äôs best you do face to face interviews. And if you think finding people is difficult, getting value from a survey is far more difficult."
3645,2021-11-21T09:32:23.582000+00:00,So any question more difficult to answer than ‚ÄúWhat color hair do you have?‚Äù Or ‚Äúwhat is your average time a day behind a computer‚Äù Should not be asked in a survey
3646,2021-11-21T09:30:05.376000+00:00,The danger of surveys is that people will answer the questions even if they have no idea.
3647,2021-11-21T09:28:24.293000+00:00,"A good rule of thumb, only use surveys for questions where people are likely to know the answer to. Like ‚ÄúHow many cats do you have?‚Äù Or ‚ÄúWhich device do you play games on‚Äù"
3648,2021-11-21T09:26:23.670000+00:00,"So you could use surveys if there‚Äôs a ‚Äòmarket‚Äô for a concept, but it‚Äôs nowhere near a concept test."
3649,2021-11-21T09:25:28.593000+00:00,"You do surveys for defining markets or screening, like finding average laptop use."
3650,2021-11-21T09:25:01.058000+00:00,"No, surveys aren‚Äôt fit for that kind of research"
3651,2021-11-21T09:02:49.899000+00:00,"So, my question is, with the process above, am I already doing a concept validation? <@!209640428151111680> <@!911268900837146674>"
3652,2021-11-21T09:01:12.611000+00:00,and after conduct the research surveys‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm trying to synthesize all the findings for ideation of the key features that I need to design.
3653,2021-11-21T08:59:52.730000+00:00,"the research question for survey are to finding out their struggle on planning their future education, their behavior on how they planning their education (such as: what they do to find information, etc)"
3654,2021-11-21T08:57:23.065000+00:00,"Before I made the survey, I already have a concept of the app in my mind (as an assumption based on the main brief). And that also help me to develop the research question."
3655,2021-11-21T08:55:02.994000+00:00,But I still not clear with what I need to do now‚Ä¶ currently I already finished the survey. I made the survey based on the brief which is about planning for future education.
3656,2021-11-21T08:52:57.171000+00:00,Hi <@!911268900837146674> & <@!209640428151111680> thanks for the explanations
3657,2021-11-21T08:48:04.797000+00:00,So you kind of got to cut through the üí© to find observations
3658,2021-11-21T08:46:25.546000+00:00,This is difficult because sometimes people will say a lot of things that are flawed rationalizations.
3659,2021-11-21T08:44:56.803000+00:00,"So the set up is kind of the same as the usability, but you‚Äôre testing ‚Äòusefulness‚Äô rather than ‚Äòusability‚Äô"
3660,2021-11-21T08:41:37.377000+00:00,Concept testing is a lot harder than usability testing though
3661,2021-11-21T08:40:43.634000+00:00,https://youtu.be/Hla1jzhan78
3662,2021-11-21T08:40:40.729000+00:00,In the pre-test interview you kind of want to smartly test if the problem exists
3663,2021-11-21T08:39:20.276000+00:00,That way you try and see in which context people would use your product
3664,2021-11-21T08:38:19.696000+00:00,"You still show it to people like you would in a usability test, but use scenarios regarding specific problem context"
3665,2021-11-21T08:37:10.285000+00:00,Concept you test the value propositions of the concept / utility rather than usability
3666,2021-11-21T08:01:54.863000+00:00,"Umm I think it just means that they want to see how you would validate your assumptions, and you can either validate through user interviews, surveys or usability testing, depending on what solution you're trying to propose, before you head down to a path of designing/building something that people might not want"
3667,2021-11-20T19:49:53.986000+00:00,"Hi, I‚Äôm kinda confused with concept validation meanings, is that the same with usability testing?. 
For the context: I have test for UX designers position, and the deliverables for the test are the design process & concept validation, flow & wireframe. No any mention for prototypes or UT in the deliverables but I just not really sure."
3668,2021-11-20T19:39:25.312000+00:00,"Yeah, for recruiting user we use different platforms"
3669,2021-11-20T17:16:28.447000+00:00,"Yeah usertesting is what we want, but they don't want to go through our govt agency security checks"
3670,2021-11-20T16:00:54.935000+00:00,"I haven't used useberry extensively but it's something I asked my designers to try out, but I think my designer likes maze more. He's doing more enterprise usability testing bc he has direct access to the users. We have usertesting for the consumer side as we need their participant pool to conduct research and such"
3671,2021-11-20T15:57:34.882000+00:00,Also yea I'm trying to build a user research team right now but most of the applicants focus on usability testing rather than generative research
3672,2021-11-20T15:56:25.306000+00:00,"My designer is using this right now and he loves it, although this doesn't have any recordings of testers screen. We have usertesting.com but it's quite expensive, but it's great for using their participant pools"
3673,2021-11-20T11:05:26.044000+00:00,Surely!
3674,2021-11-20T11:05:22.260000+00:00,"Let me dm you, it's complicated"
3675,2021-11-20T11:05:15.494000+00:00,"yes, I think so, they don't really want us to recruit for this"
3676,2021-11-20T11:05:15.301000+00:00,With as little as 100 euro a study can be quite valuable
3677,2021-11-20T11:05:01.819000+00:00,https://maze.co/
3678,2021-11-20T11:04:48.523000+00:00,"It's a quantitative way of testing usability, like tree-tests, click-tests etc"
3679,2021-11-20T11:04:17.629000+00:00,you'll need to explain that one to me; that's new to me.
3680,2021-11-20T11:04:16.340000+00:00,As recruitment is pretty cheap on that
3681,2021-11-20T11:04:05.115000+00:00,Things like maze tests too?
3682,2021-11-20T11:03:12.076000+00:00,"Yeah for me, I'm working on a project and unfortunately my client sees public quantitative research as ""promising something we might not pursue"" so I need to find other ways to get data points outside of interviews. :S"
3683,2021-11-20T11:02:17.327000+00:00,"I mean you still got to test with users eventually, but it's a good way to actually prepare those test"
3684,2021-11-20T11:01:55.227000+00:00,"Especially with accessibility, as there are very concrete guidelines you can objectively test against"
3685,2021-11-20T11:01:39.263000+00:00,Can be very valuable and a cheap way of gaining insight in something like this!
3686,2021-11-20T11:01:14.076000+00:00,"It was an audit regarding ""What makes a good wishlist?"" scoped in e-commerce apps, specifically on the metrics: Interaction Cost, system status and flexibility."
3687,2021-11-20T11:00:11.399000+00:00,I presented something like that yesterday
3688,2021-11-20T10:59:57.332000+00:00,Pretty good actually
3689,2021-11-20T10:55:59.856000+00:00,yup!
3690,2021-11-20T10:55:13.195000+00:00,"Like an expert review report, scoped in accessibility?"
3691,2021-11-20T10:54:06.876000+00:00,"like, let's say a game studio wants to learn more on accessibility and learn where in its games it can improve inclusive design. They request an audit to tell them those weak points."
3692,2021-11-20T10:51:46.018000+00:00,"I'm in a agency network, so UXR is a separate agency, UX also, copy writers also, visuals designers too. So it's like only specialized agencies. Which brings the extra dimensions of being able to sell more research as a team of researchers. Thanks for the article, will definitely help!

Audits? as in testscripts?"
3693,2021-11-20T10:49:15.019000+00:00,an aside: how do you feel about audits as a research deliverable?
3694,2021-11-20T10:47:30.862000+00:00,"+/- contractors as needed, which I lead when active"
3695,2021-11-20T10:45:23.498000+00:00,the nngroup article really helped me with that
3696,2021-11-20T10:45:09.333000+00:00,but I do agree your point a roadmap would be ideal; even if housed in something like notion/clickup/trello/jira/etc
3697,2021-11-20T10:44:28.197000+00:00,Ahh so you have a different environment so idk how useful my advice is. ^^; I am the sole researcher/designer of 300 people
3698,2021-11-20T10:43:01.754000+00:00,"Sort of yeah, it‚Äôs a research agency! Not all on the same project though, for this I‚Äôm the lead researcher though there‚Äôs a senior shadowing me."
3699,2021-11-20T10:40:35.151000+00:00,are you a team of researchers <@!209640428151111680> ?
3700,2021-11-20T10:40:05.381000+00:00,though looking at it i did forget the usability part for the outcome <:ThinkEyes:711813052433039370>
3701,2021-11-20T10:39:22.085000+00:00,"idk if that makes sense or if that is the one true way of ux, but it works for me"
3702,2021-11-20T10:39:10.829000+00:00,so I usually do brief > roadmap > research
3703,2021-11-20T10:38:50.765000+00:00,my stakeholders rarely get the roadmap; that's for the team doing the on the ground stuff
3704,2021-11-20T10:38:29.709000+00:00,if that makes sense
3705,2021-11-20T10:38:19.155000+00:00,then the roadmap is kinda a step down
3706,2021-11-20T10:38:06.789000+00:00,so that plan is all the research I plan to conduct
3707,2021-11-20T10:37:55.751000+00:00,more for one problem; not just for just interviews
3708,2021-11-20T10:37:47.764000+00:00,Rather than a level on top of that
3709,2021-11-20T10:37:18.965000+00:00,Yeah that's still the plan of action of one study correct? As in; plan of action of interviewing sessions.
3710,2021-11-20T10:35:51.614000+00:00,"I give something like this after every stakeholder kickoff. It has some dates, but it's more high level than my roadmap"
3711,2021-11-20T10:35:30.216000+00:00,"Well plans of actions aren't a problem. The thing with these is that that's still in a scope of a few weeks, or a specific study. The plan of action now needs to be more high-level, so scoping months of research rather than weeks."
3712,2021-11-20T10:33:07.097000+00:00,I have one here I can show if you want that as well
3713,2021-11-20T10:32:51.038000+00:00,"Yeah the roadmap helps, if not just to make you stop and think on your plan of action. I also do research plans/briefs"
3714,2021-11-20T10:32:24.748000+00:00,"And can't run usability test every time, because recruitment is expensive."
3715,2021-11-20T10:31:45.196000+00:00,"So now every start of the week it's kind of ""Lets plan what we do this week!"" instead of planning a road map of research, if that makes sense."
3716,2021-11-20T10:30:34.599000+00:00,"The difference with this project is that there's 40 hours of research every week; which is quite awesome, but also quite new. As usually it's like a project of several months, research gets to join for a few weeks, then if the research is done you just leave again. So very reactive in that sense."
3717,2021-11-20T10:27:48.603000+00:00,Often we research very reactive. Client comes with a problem statement and it's researched.
3718,2021-11-20T10:27:19.366000+00:00,So we need to make a plan.
3719,2021-11-20T10:27:12.505000+00:00,"I need to make one soon. I have so many research hours on my current project, that we don't really know what to do with it üòÇ"
3720,2021-11-20T10:26:45.374000+00:00,"Kinda looked like this (v1 which I used with the developer I'm working with with not so many tasks so not to overwhelm him):

I used this model as a reference. https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ux-roadmaps/

I have a more Gantt-type one for my employer, but idk if I'm allowed to show that."
3721,2021-11-20T10:23:42.198000+00:00,"I just started one for a personal project; and did one for a project that was having trouble getting off the ground, why?"
3722,2021-11-20T09:31:16.933000+00:00,Have you ever made a research roadmap <@!902908123155668993> ?
3723,2021-11-20T09:26:44.761000+00:00,"I got to do competitive expert reviewing this week, that was quite interesting. I didn't expect to get much insight out of it, but it was actually pretty inspirational."
3724,2021-11-20T09:23:19.577000+00:00,Yeah that's likely. I felt that pain in my soul
3725,2021-11-20T09:21:07.493000+00:00,But also more commonly sold (I assume) as many don't really involve research to early.
3726,2021-11-20T09:19:36.570000+00:00,"Yeah, usability testing is a lot easier than discovery research too"
3727,2021-11-20T09:19:10.684000+00:00,Ah just a free trial I see
3728,2021-11-20T09:18:27.160000+00:00,I don't know if Lookback is free
3729,2021-11-20T09:17:23.838000+00:00,<@911268900837146674> have you used use berry? Do you like it? Trying to find a platform since my employer is stalling on purchasing one
3730,2021-11-20T09:15:49.676000+00:00,Not at all. A lot of juniors start in usability though. I'd say most of my research is generative at present
3731,2021-11-20T09:15:28.560000+00:00,"Not really, though generative/discovery research is more common among service design than UX design, because the very decision of a 'device' is already a result of generative research."
3732,2021-11-20T05:24:20.441000+00:00,Question on user researchers...most of the user researchers I've talked to so far are focused mainly on usability testing rather than generative/discovery research -- is this the norm now?
3733,2021-11-20T05:21:54.417000+00:00,Try this one: https://www.useberry.com/product-overview/
3734,2021-11-20T03:18:30.907000+00:00,"https://www.hotjar.com/pricing/ has a free option.  Also, if you know who they are and they can install / use Loom https://www.loom.com/ that would be my goto."
3735,2021-11-20T01:54:41.046000+00:00,I did a Google search but these sites are really unclear about what's free or not üòî
3736,2021-11-20T01:54:14.931000+00:00,Hello! Does anyone know of any freemium/free trial remote usability testing services that records your testers screen? Looking to try one for a student project but low on the cash ü•∫

3738,2021-11-16T16:54:10.129000+00:00,"Lol, this fits quite well in the based on the last conversations."

3741,2021-11-14T18:28:37.782000+00:00,Great article about qual coding
3742,2021-11-14T16:54:35.846000+00:00,"This first pass is not the point where you want to bike shed on optimizing whatever small percentile in performance between multiple ""passing"" candidates for design."
3743,2021-11-14T16:53:35.629000+00:00,And the benefit sounds minimal. I would conduct interviews with customers and ask questions that can inform your language / tone / content. Then just use best practices for format and assume everything is good unless proven otherwise down the road.
3744,2021-11-14T16:48:38.584000+00:00,Preference testing 100+ people to find out which content/format/style of writing to use sounds like a gigantic waste of time.
3745,2021-11-13T08:51:47.768000+00:00,"If you go with surveys, don‚Äôt test the preferred way of reading. Just test how well they retained the information. This way you‚Äôd need a lot less people. As it‚Äôs no longer opinion based. This way you‚Äôll be researching an interaction effect.

This is under the assumption that the better they understand the text the better it is. (Which may not be so)

Also consider cutting down the amount of variants. Having 8 variants would require you to have *8 the required sample size"
3746,2021-11-13T08:47:46.752000+00:00,"What exactly are you curious about? The validity of your research, the process of your research, presenting your research in a case study?"
3747,2021-11-13T08:46:09.799000+00:00,So it‚Äôs better to focus the survey on recruiting people for interviewing instead
3748,2021-11-13T08:40:35.769000+00:00,"Depends on user size, if you got 1000 users of the product, 150 would give 95% confidence"
3749,2021-11-13T02:45:57.224000+00:00,"Hi, I am working on a user survey for a fintech start-up. We want to see which type of article (out of 8) in terms of content, format and style of writing, is most preferred among users. Respondents have to read a total of 10 articles which can cause the survey to be very lengthy. Hence, we are going with a simple multiple choice survey to help narrow down top few preferred articles; before doing a moderated online zoom survey to gather more qualitative feedback. 

Does anyone have any advice on the number of survey respondents we should get to achieve a significant data? I understand 100 will be sufficient but based on our current resources, it is hard to gather that many."
3750,2021-11-13T01:08:33.459000+00:00,But it did give me a better picture of what the users need and why
3751,2021-11-13T01:08:10.725000+00:00,"That makes things more clear, thank you. So I did do that research to firstly understand if it was even a problem to find a solution for. Once I knew how common these errors were, I thought of solutions to solve the problem. That's where the idea of making an app started. Following the data that I found from my initial research, I did a user survey to get more insights into user behaviour and experiences so I could better understand if the users needed an app or not. I don't know if this is the right way to do it."
3752,2021-11-12T23:07:38.789000+00:00,"Research is the tool, not the result."
3753,2021-11-12T23:01:42.846000+00:00,"Like your research of a medical error, only matters if you can now solve that error based of that research. If you‚Äôve just stated an error, you didn‚Äôt do anything new. You just observed a problem. But what now? The research is not about stating the problem it‚Äôs about solving the problem."
3754,2021-11-12T22:54:31.528000+00:00,"Research is just an argument for an incentive, or goal, if that makes sense"
3755,2021-11-12T22:38:59.755000+00:00,"Generally nobody cares about the that you did research, what the pains are, what that goals are. Or that it‚Äôs discovery, or whatever.

What is the functional value of your contribution? How does it translate to any practical value?"
3756,2021-11-12T22:31:16.469000+00:00,any input is really helpful. I appreciate it! Whatever little helps me in understanding the process and my mistakes üòÑ
3757,2021-11-12T22:30:13.074000+00:00,"I did a really in-depth research about medication errors and then I conducted a user research following that to understand what their pains and goals were.

Its just that the whole research presentation is so long that I have been asked to make it more concise. And I am finding it a hard to figure out what information to show and what to skip while making the case study make sense."
3758,2021-11-12T22:28:48.213000+00:00,this is just general portfolio advice

3762,2021-11-12T22:27:47.337000+00:00,"research for the sake of doing research doesn't align great with people who have to think about budgets, and timelines"
3763,2021-11-12T22:26:43.996000+00:00,and what you did with the things you leanred
3764,2021-11-12T22:26:40.036000+00:00,and what you learned from it
3765,2021-11-12T22:26:37.025000+00:00,"if you needed to do industry research, you should be able to explain why you did it"
3766,2021-11-12T22:26:10.601000+00:00,"I would say that in a case study, only include the things that fold neatly into your narrative"
3767,2021-11-12T22:25:56.133000+00:00,Like I am trying to understand the sequence in which I should write my case study so that it makes sense and flows well
3768,2021-11-12T22:25:25.369000+00:00,I see. So is it okay if I did an industry research before understanding the users?
3769,2021-11-12T22:24:51.926000+00:00,it does not always fit cleanly into one of these diagrams
3770,2021-11-12T22:24:34.858000+00:00,the process is the linear timeline of things you did in order to get from start to finish
3771,2021-11-12T22:24:16.619000+00:00,I wouldnt bother trying to bucket your process into steps like this
3772,2021-11-12T21:22:01.878000+00:00,"It would fall under the discovery phase, which is literally everything you do to understand the problem and the people it affects. A lot of recruiters and designers don't knitpick about splitting things up evenly into sections though. Rather than label a section ""Discovery,"" it's more helpful to explain what you did and why in the header"
3773,2021-11-12T20:07:33.503000+00:00,"Hello everyone. I am currently working on writing a case study on medication errors for a project. I am trying to define my design thinking process. I started my project by doing a research about the problem space and the medical industry from where I gathered important quantitative data such as the number of deaths per year, the expenses to make up for these errors, the number of people affected globally etc. Would this research be a part of my discovery phase or would that be something done before the discovery? Like an understanding phase. 

I need to create a graphic that shows my process like here. Would researching about the industry come before the discovery part where I understand the users? Or should I put that within the discovery phase. And what kind of research would it be? Desk research?

In short, the research I conducted was about the medical industry prior to understanding the users

Sorry, I am new to the process, so trying to figure out the best way I can make my research understandable for users who would read my case study."
3774,2021-11-12T19:48:30.440000+00:00,"I would avoid using super technical things since more often than not hiring managers and HR people are the first ones to see it, so you also want non UXR folks to have some idea of what's going on. But I do agree with my friend with the shib pfp"
3775,2021-11-12T19:45:04.735000+00:00,"In my limited experience of only working on just a few volunteer projects, most projects that non-researchers call for quant on, just want qual synthesis done faster."
3776,2021-11-12T19:41:28.536000+00:00,"I would like to do mixed methods, but none of my projects required much quant. Unless you count Google Analytics as quant research."

That client was in on the call, but had their camera and mic off. She was very good with her questions and seemed very shy and nervous because the client was there. At the end the client came off of mute and took over the interview. Trying to justify why he made it and asking me how much I would pay for it. (I would not use it even if it was free as it required another sign-in) I had to tell him that I don't need it as my phone has the functionality built-in and I can just email myself anything that I need. I wish that I would have told him that he should have done discovery research before he built it to tell him that it was a bad idea."

3816,2021-11-11T17:17:22.201000+00:00,"Design Sprints hits different when you frame it as research theatre to get leadership stakeholders properly bought into UXR. Once it‚Äôs done, move onto the Proper Research with far greater stakeholder trust."
3817,2021-11-10T18:55:52.956000+00:00,Who knows! I suppose it depends on the specific designer.
3818,2021-11-10T18:52:06.292000+00:00,I dont know if I agree! I think you might be vastly overestimating how much UX Designers actually know about research üòõ
3819,2021-11-10T18:51:25.720000+00:00,"But yes, they don't get to type in the actual report!"
3820,2021-11-10T18:50:40.874000+00:00,But that's one of the necessary evils of selling research
3821,2021-11-10T18:50:07.382000+00:00,"Yeah, this happens a lot. Especially when clients join in Lookback."
3822,2021-11-10T18:47:22.237000+00:00,"I suppose it can be a difficult position, because most senior UX people will still be better researchers / more experienced in research than I as a junior UX research."
3823,2021-11-10T18:46:02.675000+00:00,"Sometimes you really notice someone just doesn't want to kill their darling, this pollutes data a lot, so it's more as an input in a discussion."
3824,2021-11-10T18:44:34.481000+00:00,"Yeah, it very much depends. This is why I still make the final deliverable. I can be more objective because I'm more of an outside party / don't join in on the ideas or designs, so I have no assumption  (or less) to how they ought to be perceived."
3825,2021-11-10T18:43:41.156000+00:00,"Some people find it pretty easy to watch a usability test, and ignore everything that doesn't validate* the decision they want to make."
3826,2021-11-10T18:42:50.614000+00:00,"I think a lot of researchers would caution against how having the designer or product manager also being responsible for doing the research can *really* pollute the data or the way the data is interpreted. 

With that being said, I'd say that the majority of UX Designers dont have the opportunity to work directly with researchers or even talk directly to customers. For better or worse, a lot of UX Design is just piggybacking on best practices, personal experiences, and secondary research to make the most informed decision you can."
3827,2021-11-10T18:41:27.148000+00:00,Ah ok
3828,2021-11-10T18:40:24.717000+00:00,The lead UX is still the 'lead' in any case.
3829,2021-11-10T18:39:28.880000+00:00,"But currently I'm working with a UX lead, that still has more UX research experience than me being a junior UXR."
3830,2021-11-10T18:39:03.926000+00:00,"I'm responsible for the final analysis I'd say. UX Designers often join in lookback and help notulate the research. This way they also give their visions / what they've seen, but I sort of create the final document and do the synth work. So I analyse data, but doing analysis together is easier with tight deadlines. 

I still discuss this research with the lead UX and they could say ""I definitely don't agree with this part"" the main difference is just that I get paid the hours to create the deliverable."
3831,2021-11-10T18:31:45.738000+00:00,"So who analyzes the data, the UX designer? Does your work mostly revolve around researching and collecting data?"
3832,2021-11-10T18:20:40.990000+00:00,"I imagine the main difference it makes is delegating testscripts, recruitment and not having to moderate sessions?"
3833,2021-11-10T18:19:01.928000+00:00,"I guess that may be an interesting question for <@!218928410263683073>, in your experience, how does having a dedicated UXR in your team affect the process in the sprints, compared to those without?"
3834,2021-11-10T18:18:20.520000+00:00,I think there's also a big difference in teams with a dedicated researcher vs teams where research is also the UX design roles.
3835,2021-11-10T18:14:06.833000+00:00,In that perspective I suppose affinity mapping only makes sense as group activity. Just a random thought I got out of this conversation.
3836,2021-11-10T18:10:18.899000+00:00,"Yeah, I suppose it's one of these parts that becomes difficult to do together at once. Prototypes can be designed at the same time I create testscripts, a bit in collaboration of which kind of scenarios, so the prototypes fit the scenarios.  

But after a concept test / prototype test is finished UX designers don't want to be waiting for me to finish a report and do all kind of analysis all week long until they can finally start their new iteration."
3837,2021-11-10T18:00:52.443000+00:00,5 * 40 hours just for roughly validated prototype of an idea
3838,2021-11-10T18:00:13.665000+00:00,"e.g., design sprints sound really lightweight and quick, but when you consider how many hours of effort 5-7 people for an entire week is, its actually nuts when you consider what you get out of it."
3839,2021-11-10T17:59:29.317000+00:00,Yes. In general this is true of many of the group activities.
3840,2021-11-10T17:50:21.011000+00:00,"Still can be valuable I suppose, but only if you got no deadline stress"
3841,2021-11-10T17:46:05.297000+00:00,More valuable for designing than for creating reports
3842,2021-11-10T17:43:35.365000+00:00,"It‚Äôs an immersive activity I suppose, rather than hard analysis"
3843,2021-11-10T17:41:10.732000+00:00,You do that in your head
3844,2021-11-10T17:40:39.702000+00:00,And affinity mapping doesn‚Äôt create as much value if it‚Äôs just a research deliverable.
3845,2021-11-10T17:36:18.686000+00:00,"This is at my specific agency though, so unsure how industry wide that is."
3846,2021-11-10T17:35:35.846000+00:00,Analysis isn‚Äôt the easiest thing to sell.
3847,2021-11-10T17:35:19.303000+00:00,And affinity mapping costs a lot of time.
3848,2021-11-10T17:34:44.960000+00:00,Time constraints. Between collecting data and delivering a client report there‚Äôs about 2-3 days.
3849,2021-11-10T17:29:41.198000+00:00,Why?
3850,2021-11-10T16:48:21.176000+00:00,"This is definitely interesting to read too.

https://dscout.com/people-nerds/qualitative-analysis-any-timeline"
3851,2021-11-10T16:40:56.002000+00:00,Especially if you got like 20 themes
3852,2021-11-10T16:40:45.782000+00:00,Then you can rank them based on amount of dots.
3853,2021-11-10T16:39:17.073000+00:00,Though that more to discuss scope than to measure critical issues
3854,2021-11-10T16:38:34.959000+00:00,We often used a voting system where each person has like 3-5 red dots üî¥ where each person votes their most important theme
3855,2021-11-10T16:36:04.533000+00:00,even if its just some sort of dot voting or stack ranking during the same session
3856,2021-11-10T16:35:31.586000+00:00,so I'd argue that something like an affinity diagram method should be paired with some sort of weighting exercise
3857,2021-11-10T16:35:10.996000+00:00,"For someone not involved in the initial study, they just see groups of things that are all equally important"
3858,2021-11-10T16:34:48.775000+00:00,"I'd say that there is a risk when using affinity diagrams to create ""artifacts"", where you're basically inserting a layer of abstraction between the user doing something, and what you're going to do about it, where your translation between observation and product decision is entirely unweighted on paper"
3859,2021-11-10T16:34:03.419000+00:00,"Which is why an actual whiteboard is much more valuable for this than just miro, imo."
3860,2021-11-10T16:33:38.129000+00:00,"Yeah, it gives a holistic level view"
3861,2021-11-10T16:32:28.942000+00:00,"just in the way it lets me unpack what I (or others) saw, so that I can understand it at a granular level"
3862,2021-11-10T16:31:54.620000+00:00,I find a lot of value in the process of going through this method with other people when it comes to taking apart observational data from user tests
3863,2021-11-10T16:30:54.684000+00:00,Sadly I never get the time to do this anymore as a researcher.
3864,2021-11-10T16:30:14.346000+00:00,"The desired outcome of an affinity diagram is not so much an artifact as it is an upleveling of your understanding of information surrounding a stimulus.

There is no real wrong way to do it. As long as you're discussing the data set, and making observations and insights as you ""cluster"" pieces of data, your method is of net benefit to your team."
3865,2021-11-10T16:30:01.457000+00:00,"For further synthesis you can turn themes into insight statements, POV, user stories. Which you can then again turn into design principles."

3879,2021-11-09T20:49:22.500000+00:00,"We usually do monthly income, but I suppose it comes down to the same thing"
3880,2021-11-09T20:45:49.490000+00:00,"You can ask an approximation of a yearly income and education level, that's somewhat common to see in some surveys for participant recruitment"
3881,2021-11-09T20:17:53.430000+00:00,"Hey guys, while designing screening questions if you want to know which tier city or scoial economic class does a user is coming from how can we go about framing the question."
3882,2021-11-09T16:31:39.929000+00:00,"The role I applied for asked for 3 years, so don‚Äôt take it too seriously and apply anyway."
3883,2021-11-09T16:30:47.135000+00:00,"I got my role with 0 years of experience, so it‚Äôs not like they don‚Äôt exist."
3884,2021-11-09T16:04:31.282000+00:00,It seems to me that UX Design is an entry level role for UXR as I cannot find any UXR roles that ask for 0 years of experience.
3885,2021-11-09T06:54:32.833000+00:00,"I wonder why they want a background in visual design, maybe they want you to make pretty user journeys?ü§î"
3886,2021-11-09T06:49:50.052000+00:00,So lots of bigger companies should provide 100% uxr roles
3887,2021-11-09T06:48:19.286000+00:00,"I‚Äôm one of the few with a UX background in my research team, most studied psych. We do 0% visual design."
3888,2021-11-08T19:43:54.020000+00:00,What are some entry-level roles for ux research that do not require a background in visual design?
3889,2021-11-06T09:14:31.208000+00:00,But this may vary a lot per company.
3890,2021-11-06T09:10:54.333000+00:00,What sometimes happens to is that they'll ask for a full time UXR for 2 years.
3891,2021-11-06T09:10:12.858000+00:00,"One of my colleagues actually fit so well in the team at the client side, she switched jobs to them. (which usually isn't really the norm)"
3892,2021-11-06T09:08:05.945000+00:00,"Often it's just team work! So team work like any other, often you're even allowed to work at their office too. So I'm not sure there are any strong differences in responsibility. I imagine it also depends why external people are hired."
3893,2021-11-06T09:05:02.909000+00:00,"Place I applied to also asked for 3 year exp, got the job anyway, so always try!"
3894,2021-11-06T04:16:16.478000+00:00,"Thanks, Dario. Are there instances where the client‚Äôs UXD/Rs do the research/facilitation and they‚Äôd share the results or painpoints with you? Just wanted to know the potential of working with them, like what kind of work should be done by them and should be done by us, if there any limitations, etc. üòä"
3895,2021-11-06T00:34:15.723000+00:00,"I've been trying to get my first UXR job as well. I did a ux design bootcamp, but I would not recommend it unless you have visual design experience and are looking to transition to ux. The comment was meant for Elias as that is what I think has helped me feel like I should be close to getting a job. Most places are just asking for 3+ years of experience, but it seems like some people are starting to get jobs without the many years of experience."
3896,2021-11-05T23:28:08.324000+00:00,Ok thank you!
3897,2021-11-05T23:12:21.074000+00:00,It's just getting my first UXR job.
3898,2021-11-05T23:12:11.367000+00:00,I've had research experience.
3899,2021-11-05T22:16:49.586000+00:00,"I would definitely speak with professors and grad students. I would look for labs or professors that deals with human factors, cognitive ergonomics, or perception. (Those were the labs that are closely related in my experience) Tell them that you are interested in User Experience Research and ask if they have any advice for you or if they know of someone better to talk to about it."

I'm in a group that meets weekly to talk about what we are currently working on, struggling with, etc. My desired position is not strictly a UX Researcher, but one of the members in the weekly group is in a similar position as you. Even though I am not strictly UX research, I'm trying to learn as much as I can right now as I dive into the design world, would love to talk more and bounce questions off each other or whatever works."
3907,2021-11-04T19:45:27.979000+00:00,"Hey all! I'm looking to talk with some people who are entering their career as a UX Researcher. I am beginner level in my career, still a student, and currently focused on: 
1) Building my portfolio
2) Applying to internships and jobs
3) Passion projects/ freelance projects

I haven't found many UX Researchers specifically who are in a similar place in their career. I'd love to chat about some successes, struggles, and stories we share in common"
3908,2021-11-04T08:13:45.338000+00:00,"I think the useful thing about working together with client side UX designers is that they know a lot more about the users, since they have been dealing with them for very long, so it's good to take that seriously. They are much more emotionally involved with the design than you are, so also keep mind of that."
3909,2021-11-04T08:12:55.426000+00:00,I work at an agency as UX researcher yeah. Lots of clients also have their own designers and developers.
3910,2021-11-04T03:22:41.828000+00:00,"Hi all. I‚Äôm wondering if any UX designers here works for an agency and have experienced working with a client that also has their own UX Designers ‚Äî or a similar type of setup? Im asking because I wanted to learn about the processes that took place, what worked and didn‚Äôt work. Our team is considering working with clients that has their own UX Designers so we could test out our designs. Due to privacy we are not able to directly contact/test our designs with the end-users that‚Äôs why we‚Äôre thinking about the potential of working together with our client‚Äôs UX Design/Research team (if they have one). Any advice would be  greatly appreciated üòä"
3911,2021-11-04T01:38:28.505000+00:00,"Awesome thank you, that makes much more sense for right now. Going to work through this article"
3912,2021-11-03T20:45:06.663000+00:00,"and instead of trying to craft hyper specific tailored solutions for pain points based on the persona, its far more straight forward to look at the bigger picture and then cross section for side cases and edge cases and demographic nuance after you have a more firm grasp on how you're going to tackle the shared pain points."
3913,2021-11-03T20:43:40.525000+00:00,You might spend a bunch of time just to discover that it doesn't matter /why/ people are getting their cars detailed‚Äîthat they all care about the same things in the common scenarios around getting your car detailed

3915,2021-11-03T20:41:17.492000+00:00,"that conflation of pain points being tied to a persona is going to be really common when you start trying to slice you ""users"" up into groups of people rather than what the scenarios are."
3916,2021-11-03T20:40:22.913000+00:00,I would maybe focus less on the personas and more on the scenarios
3917,2021-11-03T19:53:16.097000+00:00,From my research I have found 3 different groups. My research found that one of the big differences between these groups is the money they are willing to spend on each detailing package. Now the obvious goal is for these customers to have their car detailed right? I think I am also having trouble separating more of the business research from specifically the UX research that focuses on the actual product. Is there a good amount of overlap between the two?
3918,2021-11-03T17:56:58.538000+00:00,Is it an assumed difference? Or was there data in the research that showed it?
3919,2021-11-03T17:55:44.563000+00:00,I think it depends on what is differentiating the personas. Is it something that would differentiate their behaviors on the site? Or is it what options they pick and still go through the same sales funnel?
3920,2021-11-03T13:37:46.030000+00:00,Would it be possible for these to be the same or very similar for each persona?
3921,2021-11-02T21:00:36.151000+00:00,"In terms of needs vs frustrations, I see a need as being a requirement in order to reach the goal. Sometimes frustrations are inverse of needs, but it should genuinely be something that people do not enjoy and would prevent them reaching their goal."
3922,2021-11-02T21:00:15.249000+00:00,"This is perfect thank you, I knew I had to be missing something"
3923,2021-11-02T20:58:51.716000+00:00,The goal in your scenario may be to purchase a vehicle.
3924,2021-11-02T20:58:22.822000+00:00,It seems like you're describing needs rather than goals.
3925,2021-11-02T20:57:24.914000+00:00,hopefully that helps show the distinctions better.

3927,2021-11-02T20:36:34.010000+00:00,"At what point do we stop drilling deeper in JTBD? In the often repeated example, ""People don't want to buy a drill, they want a hole"", can't we dig deeper and ask ""People don't want a hole, they want to hang a photo on the wall."", followed by ""People don't want to hang a photo on a wall, they want to feel connected to their family."" At this point, a drill seems like not that great of a product to connect people with ther families.. so how does at point does JTBD drilling down end?"
3928,2021-11-02T20:08:48.878000+00:00,"I'm finding that my goals/fustrations for my personas are similar. Is it frowned upon to remove these from each individual persona in certain cases and just go with a more general approach? This is for a mobile vehicle detailing website I am building. 

Frustrations and goals I always felt seem to be just problems and solutions, so where I am at right now based off my research is the users 1) want to be able to shop for more specific detailing options, instead of being forced to purchase a bundle. 2) they want to be able to quickly book and schedule without having to message back and forth with management. 3) they want to see the quality work that comes with a higher end price point.

I am new to the field as you can tell so I apologize if I am way off on this idea."
3929,2021-11-01T22:13:59.605000+00:00,It depends on what the context of the survey is for specific advice. This article seems to cover most of the basics.

3940,2021-10-27T05:13:56.585000+00:00,Just like a visual design can be researched
3941,2021-10-27T05:12:14.919000+00:00,Which can be researched
3942,2021-10-27T05:12:04.772000+00:00,They‚Äôre information architecture / interactive design

User flows are just diagrams, but we use them to better empathize with users, identify pain points, and to identify what kind of features/interfaces they might need.

3945,2021-10-27T01:45:57.161000+00:00,Are user flows considered a form of ux research or design?

3947,2021-10-26T04:41:43.016000+00:00,"Yup the former. Non directed interview
For eg: she starts with the germinal question : ""What went through your mind when you planned on eating out during the pandemic""
Then one of them responds with "" Do you want to tell you about the last time I successfully ate out or do you want me to tell you about the time I tried to eat out?""
So now we have 2 threads to explore."
3948,2021-10-25T19:23:54.471000+00:00,Does she mean using probing questions and just have the participant talk about the one question and pull on the threads? Or just ask the question and shut up until the participant taps out?

3953,2021-10-25T16:09:35.364000+00:00,"1. I always ask myself is this research or a design decision. If the latter, it is a HE
2. If I'm the team's designated UXR, then I run every HE unless the designers are trained in how to do it (most are not and that is why researchers do it) 
3. I prefer a mix of at least 2 of the following - myself + another UXR + a senior designer that didn't design it + (the designer that made the design being the last person to reach out to)
4. I prefer people that I've observed with great or horrible ""Product Sense"" not just people with specific titles
5. prototypes
6. identifying all constraints + edgecases
7. comments in figma 
8. Design decisions should always be run by the stakeholders that know the most about constraints and edge cases which is often the product manager but only if they somehow impact outcomes in more than usability. if just usability, having a 1:1 w the designer is fine
9. typically, mature research orgs would move away from usability testing and instead have HEs that are run by designers in collaboration with researchers IMO"
3954,2021-10-25T16:02:33.798000+00:00,"Hey everyone! I have a topic I wanted to get some opinion on. I thought this channel would be a good space to start.

Over the last year or so, I formalised and run a number of ""Usability Reviews"" within the design team I work on. Part of this review is a Heuristic Evaluation based on a process outlined here by nnGroup (https://www.nngroup.com/articles/how-to-conduct-a-heuristic-evaluation/). The review outputs usability issues related heuristics and user scenarios from multiple evaluators.

I wanted to get a general sense of how this group views the usefulness of HEs. I've listed a few questions below that I'd love some feedback on... 

1. Do you, or the company you work for have heuristic evaluations built into a process that you undertake?
2. How frequently do you partake in a heuristic evaluation, either as the organiser, or as an evaluator?
3. On average, how many evaluators take part in your reviews?
4. How would you describe the evaluators selected to work on the review (i.e. they're UX experts with experience in relevant fields like eCommerce, or they're general UX designers / researchers)
5. What systems do you perform the evaluations on (prototypes, release candidate builds, production builds, etc).
6. What challenges do you face when conducting or contributing to a HE (example: controlling scope, team alignment, documentation etc.)
7. How do you document Usability issues?
8. What happens after the HE has been completed. How do you action the results, are they presented to stakeholders etc.?
9. In your opinion, how important are HEs to the product design process, and what is the usefulness / benefit of them comparatively to say user testing.

Would be interested to get anyone's take on the above. Thanks!"

3978,2021-10-23T08:35:23.640000+00:00,Which is a very effective way of practicing interviewing and analysis

3980,2021-10-23T08:34:48.693000+00:00,Also look into laddering analysis
3981,2021-10-23T08:34:26.306000+00:00,"For your first interviews I‚Äôd advice to record your interviews, write out transcripts 100% accurately to the audio. 

Then analyse your own questions and their answers. This way you can apply something like the 5 why‚Äôs, using different marking colors for each time you go ‚Äòdeeper‚Äô in the same question.

It‚Äôs also useful to see where your own questions were flawed: like leading questions, loaded questions or any flawed question in general."
3982,2021-10-23T08:23:37.144000+00:00,"We also write key questions guides for qualitative interviews (bit like a test script) based on the research questions to ensure the scope of the questioning. This is just a skeleton to ensure everything is asked we don‚Äôt blindly follow it.

This has two key functions though;

1: researchers that are not on the project should be able to do your interviews; without any prior knowledge of the research or product.

2: sharing the script with stakeholders to ensure you‚Äôre on the same page.

Both of these things are probably not things you need to worry about in your first ever project!"
3983,2021-10-23T05:28:37.660000+00:00,^
3984,2021-10-23T03:59:41.033000+00:00,"something i would recommend for all researchers is to practice a mock interview with one of your coworkers or friends prior to the actual sessions (only if it is practical to do so - the people you are interviewing are not specialized like attorneys or cpa's) 
Doing a dummy run helps not only you to practice saying the script out loud but also to better write the questions you've written. you'll notice people answering questions the way you weren't expecting. you can use that and ask yourself, is it an insight or is it a poorly worded question? 

also, i would say that asking the right questions is extremely important for researchers and putting thought into the wording is crucial. I would not consider spending more time to properly write out a question to be a ""waste of time"" or ""overthinking."" 

mistakes will be made but you should be trying things and learning from why that decision was a mistake and not just going in willy nilly"
3985,2021-10-23T03:48:56.244000+00:00,"Don't waste too much time over thinking if your questions are good enough. First project ever, you should expect it not be perfect. Make mistakes, learn from it, improve it next time.
Interviewing is also the same, you won't get the perfect interview without having any experience.
In my first interview ever, I thought I had some good set of questions, but after that interview I realised how much more I could have done.
So expect you'd make mistakes in earlier stages, and make learning your priority."
3986,2021-10-23T00:44:40.683000+00:00,"So you'd say that even though I have kind of this little list of questions, I should be ready to pull on those threads?"
3987,2021-10-23T00:41:13.456000+00:00,"Its qualitative interviews. It's my first project ever and I want to do well, but spent way too much time over-analyzing."
3988,2021-10-22T19:58:50.079000+00:00,"If you're talking about a prototype driven moderated session, you can write a script of anticipated words and questions in a sequential order where it matches the prototype transitions. 

If you're talking about qualitative interviews for discoveries, part of being an experienced researcher is not just following a series of questions but being able to identify threads that has thoughts worth discovering."
3989,2021-10-22T19:52:35.009000+00:00,"Hi! Weird question for anyone who can answer. When you write questions for your interviews, what does it look like for you?"
3990,2021-10-22T03:52:06.423000+00:00,I think its 40 min limit on 3 person session. If it's less than 3 maybe can be more than 40 mins ( not sure)
3991,2021-10-22T02:00:37.439000+00:00,no problem! keep me posted!

4018,2021-10-21T07:23:37.493000+00:00,"Yeah, generally incentives take very little of the total cost here though"

4020,2021-10-21T07:22:58.964000+00:00,What do you mean when you say counting incentives? Like user reward?

4022,2021-10-21T07:11:19.160000+00:00,^ thats not counting incentives btw
4023,2021-10-21T07:11:03.286000+00:00,Bad participants = bad data = bad decisions. That‚Äôs the risk you take with lowballing on recruitment.
4024,2021-10-21T07:10:05.972000+00:00,"read through the cost for recruitment, that's very costly omg. my colleague used fb ads and it wasn't too expensive. but it will also depend on the reach specifics etc. but thank you all :)"

4044,2021-10-20T16:42:08.926000+00:00,Of course. But there's often reasons to seek either specialist protocols/profiles. And having a smart and flexible recruitment person in-house or from a 3rd party is worth it's weigh in gold when you've got a complex study to organise.

4050,2021-10-20T14:28:11.169000+00:00,we've never paid more than like $150 per participant for interviews or usability tests...and i'm talking the more involved ones

4053,2021-10-20T14:25:18.143000+00:00,I guess the only cheap way is doing it yourself

Currently only have fb survey ads as option but i'm looking for alternatives. i'm aware there's a channel in this server but i'm looking for local users and would like to have a wider reach within the local community :)"
4057,2021-10-20T03:19:02.548000+00:00,"I'd first define my research questions and then based upon that, frame interview questions to find answers to those research questions.
Now you just have to dig deep and ask questions that will bring you close to getting answers to your initial questions. Think about the 5Ws while doing this. 
Also at this point I wouldn't even think about personas."
4058,2021-10-19T18:46:16.226000+00:00,"Hey UXers, I will be conducting some user research soon, interviewing customers so that we can build personas and gain a better understanding of their wants and needs out of a new feature we are launching. Does anyone have a good guide/set of questions that they have used in the past? They can be super broad, or if they pertain to the industry you work in specifically then that works as well. This is my first time conducting user research in a non academic setting so any tips would be appreciated! Thanks everyone!"

4061,2021-10-18T21:19:01.440000+00:00,But that also depends on the specific role I suppose
4062,2021-10-18T21:17:38.746000+00:00,Had several days for that
4063,2021-10-18T21:17:10.521000+00:00,"I had a research challenge, could choose any website, then had to write a testscript, recruit three users, do shared screen usability tests and present the results as if they were a client"
4064,2021-10-18T20:28:47.648000+00:00,Nothing specific. I think that they'll give me a hypothetical scenario and I'll have to generate a plan on the spot
4065,2021-10-18T20:27:01.764000+00:00,Any context?
4066,2021-10-18T20:26:56.037000+00:00,The research challenge is for a 1-hour long interview. So I assume the first half would involve me creating a research outline/plan and second half would include discussion.
4067,2021-10-18T20:26:53.222000+00:00,What kind of research?
4068,2021-10-18T20:26:19.406000+00:00,Yeah that would be extremeüëÄ

4073,2021-10-18T18:52:17.145000+00:00,Here they usually got to do an 8 hour case study

4077,2021-10-18T16:48:31.242000+00:00,What I mean by in general is that the interviewee decides what method to use based on the prompt and creates a research plan for that
4078,2021-10-18T16:47:29.238000+00:00,I guess <@!420113506386444288> needs to ask the specific context

4082,2021-10-18T16:45:34.518000+00:00,This is specifically for a usability study yeah
4083,2021-10-18T16:44:51.483000+00:00,A plan for ‚Äòin general‚Äô seems a bit weird
4084,2021-10-18T16:39:42.213000+00:00,It seems like it would be more for a usability study and not just ux research in general

4086,2021-10-18T16:35:15.004000+00:00,If shouldn‚Äôt be different
4087,2021-10-18T16:35:04.016000+00:00,Yes but since you say it‚Äôs a roleplay
4088,2021-10-18T16:34:27.763000+00:00,I think Jed was asking about a job interview

4090,2021-10-18T16:33:34.504000+00:00,But it‚Äôs a possible white board challenge

4092,2021-10-18T16:32:38.079000+00:00,No this is for client work shops
4093,2021-10-18T16:31:28.392000+00:00,yeah
4094,2021-10-18T16:31:08.483000+00:00,For me?
4095,2021-10-18T16:30:38.166000+00:00,is this for a job interview?
4096,2021-10-18T16:28:52.871000+00:00,Then after it‚Äôs finished this is structured into the research plan itself
4097,2021-10-18T16:25:37.520000+00:00,We plan about 1.5 hour for this
4098,2021-10-18T16:24:55.486000+00:00,"In our template we structure it as:

1: What do we want to get out of this test / key questions 

2: what do we want to know before the test starts? (Pre-test interview)

3: what do we want to ask after the test? (post-test interview/evaluative interview)

4: we go through each scenario (which have been discussed with the ux designers) put all screens and put post its on specific screen elements with questions

In this session we use a color for each person, which is usually the client, the ux designer, and the UX researcher"
4099,2021-10-18T16:18:32.525000+00:00,We call these script sessions
4100,2021-10-18T16:08:39.432000+00:00,I would definitely double check that it is a research challenge and not a regular design challenge.
4101,2021-10-18T16:06:01.804000+00:00,"I don't have any experience doing them, but from what I understand it is basically creating a high-level research plan for a hypothetical problem and roleplaying as if the interviewers are the stakeholders.

If anyone has experience with these uxr challenges as well I'd love to chat about it, thank you!!"
4103,2021-10-17T14:18:22.752000+00:00,For free (iirc)
4104,2021-10-17T14:17:43.844000+00:00,"You can also do A/B tests that way in tag manager, making variants of specific buttons"
4105,2021-10-17T14:16:57.770000+00:00,To see if there are any elements that are never interacted with
4106,2021-10-17T14:16:32.971000+00:00,You can count each time someone clicks it
4107,2021-10-17T14:16:11.752000+00:00,With tag manager you can put the links in specific buttons
4108,2021-10-17T14:05:20.304000+00:00,Aslong it‚Äôs in the browser you should be able to put in the tags
4109,2021-10-17T13:56:19.885000+00:00,portals can still have navigational issues
4110,2021-10-17T13:55:58.946000+00:00,just put in trackers in the URL links
4111,2021-10-17T13:55:53.876000+00:00,im sure theres still ways to get similar analytics
4112,2021-10-17T13:55:30.874000+00:00,It‚Äôs not a site. It‚Äôs like a portal for internal use.
4113,2021-10-16T08:24:40.773000+00:00,May have to set up your site with some google analytics. It‚Äôll show you the navigation path as well
4114,2021-10-16T07:28:51.595000+00:00,yes
4115,2021-10-16T07:06:23.206000+00:00,Does it work for web portals?
4116,2021-10-16T06:17:21.918000+00:00,"Google tag manager, where you can track how much certain buttons/elements are clicked"
4117,2021-10-16T02:08:15.178000+00:00,"Hey everyone!

What important quantitative data would be useful to collect as far as internal tools for a company?

I'm trying to figure out:
- Are all of the pages being utilized? How? How long are people spending time on these pages?
- Heatmaps would probably be ideal too so I can see their activity per page. 
- Are users lost when navigating through the pages? Can they easily find what they're looking for/need?

Is there anything else I missed?"
4118,2021-10-15T04:40:00.698000+00:00,"If after research you get different results from your initial assumptions, that's still okay. You can refine your problem statements and focus on that new target users. If you're looking for research role yes, doing deep UX research is important"
4119,2021-10-15T04:32:20.727000+00:00,I did do real research of articles to see if this was actually a problem wide enough to invest my time into for a case study. I found out a lot of info from that research and then went ahead and did real user survey using google forms. From that data I found that most replies were from 18-32 year olds. Also maybe because I did not have any specific target demographic that I wanted to send the survey to. Please correct me if I am doing things wrong since I am new to UX.
4120,2021-10-15T04:30:07.241000+00:00,Well the app will be used by a wide demographic. From teenagers to elderly. Initially the idea was to make something that my grandpa could use (before I even knew what UX design was a couple of years ago) but then I went ahead and made it into a case study for my college where I studied interactive media design and UX was a small part of it but not in depth. I want to become a UX designers but a few of these concepts are not 100% clear.
4121,2021-10-15T03:57:35.746000+00:00,And yes if you want to solve a problem then ofc you need to do real research
4122,2021-10-15T03:56:42.647000+00:00,Who will be using the app?
4123,2021-10-15T00:20:39.628000+00:00,"I am working on a mock project for my portfolio. Conducted user survey online but found that most of the replies were from 18-32 year old. The product that I am doing the case study on is a medication tracking app. The idea for the app came when I was taking care of my grandpa for 5 years and seeing him take over 20 medicines using pill boxes to keep track of his doses but nothing told him of the timings for each dose. 

For the project I wanted to have a wider target audience including some older people like my grand father who is 80+. 

My question is whether it is fine to include an older demographic in the research (which would not have come from the actual user survey data) and how can I present it when I show the user survey data in the case study.

Another question I have is whether conducting real user interviews and user tests is a must for mock projects since I was not able to find enough users to conduct an interview with since my timeline for the college project was limited."

If possible, you could send quick survey via email into your target users and list all the possible names. 
Or you can also run some competitive analysis. Look at Habitica for inspirations"

My company is building an app that lets you track the online content you consume. You just save something from the web, for example a YouTube video. The app stores this piece of content for you, lets you set a motivation (""Why do you want to learn this""), tracks your progress and provides optional quizzes, so that if you pass, the content saves in your profile as ""learnt"".

What might we call these little ""learning journeys""? ""Learning Journey"" or ""Learning Path"" is such an exhausted expression. ""Micro-course"" doesn't sound engaging either. Do you have any ideas? What would you think about calling it a ""quest""? Any ideas, thoughts?"
4144,2021-10-12T07:28:36.273000+00:00,I get max 2/3 days for both analysing and finishing a report from the moment the data is collected
4145,2021-10-12T07:28:20.167000+00:00,Sadly time for such deep analysis methods is usually not in the budget too

4147,2021-10-12T07:27:05.224000+00:00,"Although I finished my UX bootcamp, I still consider myself a student. This is for an event organizer that I'm volunteering with. Thinking about it now, it certainly does seem like content strategy is a big part of it. The main problem is that they need more engagement in order to build a good community. Right now the only regular users are those who are related to the events that they host, but after the event is over, the community kind of peters out until the next event. IMO, engagement can be grown through offering decent content on a regular basis. Perhaps I need to do research to figure what sort of content or methods of engaging would be most relevant to their users. However, more pressing is the website redesign because their next event is going to happen early next year."
4148,2021-10-12T07:26:56.031000+00:00,Sounds like something left to the data scientist
4149,2021-10-12T06:57:33.952000+00:00,"But unsure if it goes into this field as well (and even then, *which* methods)"
4150,2021-10-12T06:57:24.572000+00:00,I have for a fact used it for operations research and management scenarios
4151,2021-10-12T06:54:57.830000+00:00,How much does MCDM (multi-criteria decision making) methods and algos prevail in UX Research?

4153,2021-10-12T05:40:45.531000+00:00,Then take that back to them to read

In terms of what you do on a day to day basis, what are the goals of the product?

4160,2021-10-12T04:45:08.559000+00:00,"Well community engagement is a big part of this website since the organization is an event organizer. They want to build a community, and the website is a means to help reach that goal. But it's difficult for them to translate growing as a community into short term goals for the website because they themselves are unsure of what sort of messaging or approach they need to take to build up this community."
4161,2021-10-12T04:13:04.518000+00:00,it kind of feels like you're here for a website design? branding? project but they keep turning the conversation to something else like community engagement(?). You may want to address it early on and clarify what your effort and time should be spent on.
4162,2021-10-12T04:10:43.488000+00:00,"and for extra measure, follow-up with an email or slack restating these points so that you're on the same page"

The stakeholders talked a lot about their future plans for the community of their website, and not so much about concrete goals for the website, other than it should be ""flexible enough to account for future features"". The main issues they brought up were a lack of community engagement, however that applies to the organization's list of products as a whole. Maybe I didn't do a good enough job of asking the right questions during the interview.. but I'm wondering how I can define the project goals and scope. Does anyone have suggestions on this?"

4174,2021-10-07T13:14:02.275000+00:00,While also knowing how certain you are (needing more research)
4175,2021-10-07T13:13:48.994000+00:00,Because then you also have insight on how difficult the research will be (how easy to uncover)

4185,2021-10-07T13:06:30.876000+00:00,Because this tells you what to research more
4186,2021-10-07T13:06:15.783000+00:00,You want to focus on low certainty but high impact
4187,2021-10-07T13:05:58.635000+00:00,Actually
4188,2021-10-07T13:05:42.936000+00:00,Or
4189,2021-10-07T13:05:24.415000+00:00,Yepp
4190,2021-10-07T13:03:38.562000+00:00,"But the layout doesn't matter, you just want low effort, high fact"
4191,2021-10-07T13:03:35.549000+00:00,"Oh by "">"" did you mean the side?"
4192,2021-10-07T13:03:23.543000+00:00,In this layout yes
4193,2021-10-07T13:02:48.196000+00:00,So can also be fact > assumption
4194,2021-10-07T13:02:29.293000+00:00,"Doesn't matter which side you do what, that will just change the dimension of the quadrant"
4195,2021-10-07T12:59:48.562000+00:00,Or I got it wrong?
4196,2021-10-07T12:59:27.610000+00:00,"I didn't understand what you meant by : assumption > definitely fact

Did you mean assumption has more weight than fact?

Shouldn't it be the opposite?"
4197,2021-10-07T12:57:42.462000+00:00,"Basically way to map certainty, so assumption > definitely fact"
4198,2021-10-07T12:55:44.781000+00:00,"Ok how do I define "" How well do i know it""? 

Like I might think I know something, but i might be wrong?"
4199,2021-10-07T12:55:15.457000+00:00,Based on existing research
4200,2021-10-07T12:55:10.251000+00:00,Which can also have the addition of new questions
4201,2021-10-07T12:54:53.346000+00:00,Yes
4202,2021-10-07T12:54:50.236000+00:00,"""How well do i know it"""
4203,2021-10-07T12:54:48.239000+00:00,"So impact on Y and on X we can do ""How certain are we about this?"""
4204,2021-10-07T12:54:38.048000+00:00,not insight
4205,2021-10-07T12:54:35.903000+00:00,oh sorry
4206,2021-10-07T12:54:23.262000+00:00,Insight isn't really a scale
4207,2021-10-07T12:53:56.347000+00:00,"So we can basically put anything in the X and Y axes right? 

In my case you asked to put ""insights""  on Y and ""impact""  on X"
4208,2021-10-07T12:53:39.232000+00:00,They can be used in many different ways / contexts
4209,2021-10-07T12:52:24.845000+00:00,"However, with different words"
4210,2021-10-07T12:51:51.688000+00:00,
4211,2021-10-07T12:51:49.730000+00:00,"Yeah, this is usually the idea"
4212,2021-10-07T12:32:48.771000+00:00,"Oo yes this is deffo helpful, I've never used it before. Lemme look it up"
4213,2021-10-07T10:58:14.963000+00:00,"Personas aside and empathy maps aside, as this doesn't really matter in this stage"
4214,2021-10-07T10:57:48.072000+00:00,Then things that are places on Not Certain & High Impact (in relation to goal) are things you could use
4215,2021-10-07T10:57:15.536000+00:00,But then change X and Y value; X = Very certain / Not Certain Y = High impact / Low Impact
4216,2021-10-07T10:56:16.129000+00:00,Look up Prioritization Matrices
4217,2021-10-07T10:54:29.826000+00:00,"A quadrant matrix for your insights basically, let me see if I can find an example"
4218,2021-10-07T10:53:00.464000+00:00,"Then that's good!

Sounds like you just need to reflect on where you are now, what data you're still missing and what you need to know. 

What could work good for this is a matrix, in which you place you insights. Where the X axis defines; how well do you know it? (and what do you now know) and the Y axis defines impact of knowledge"
4219,2021-10-07T08:45:22.291000+00:00,"Yea right now I just have the insights from interview. I don't have clear problem statement yet ( which I'm trying to define).
So to reach there, I'm trying to put everything into context, the what, why, how, when, so after its all clear to me, I can create the problem statement.

So to have a clear problem statement, im trying to narrow down my findings so far to reach that point.

About the fish part, idk how I can relate to that, because in my case the initial problem was people missing their stops.
So now to uncover the reasons, why people miss their stops and what are the reasons/events that lead to it, I did interviews.

I found out that very few of them miss their stops, but instead most of them are really worried about missing their stops.

So my goal right now would be to narrow down every of the insights I've gained so far and to get a clear idea behind the reasons why people might be worried.

I mean im not really blind researching if I were to say, because I have an idea of what might be the problem, so I'm trying to narrow down into the reasons behind that problem.

Its not like I'm trying to provide a solution for people to wake up in time ( like catching trout), when the initial problem was people missing their stops ( catching salmon)"
4220,2021-10-07T08:35:30.663000+00:00,Where each fish can be seen as a goal or painpoint
4221,2021-10-07T08:35:02.615000+00:00,"And then the client will be like ""Yes but I only care about salmon, so why did you waste all that time fishing for these other fish?"""
4222,2021-10-07T08:34:39.364000+00:00,"Then you come back and catch a few Trout, Cat fish, Salmon, bunch of other fish and present the insight ""This place is great for fishing Trout, Cat Fish, salmon and all these fishes!"""
4223,2021-10-07T08:31:58.761000+00:00,"You're going on a fishing trip, just catching a few fish and you come back and present the fish you caught. Even though maybe the initial goal was to just catch salmon, because you've been asked ""What's the best place to go fishing for salmon?"""
4224,2021-10-07T08:28:42.728000+00:00,"What you seem to doing now (which is my assumption, so maybe you aren't) is doing blind research. You go in, uncover insights, but what, how, why you're going to use isn't clear"
4225,2021-10-07T08:24:46.608000+00:00,As in; you need to define your outcome before you start the work; in your case; a clear problem statement which you can start to ideate on (I assume)
4226,2021-10-07T08:23:49.880000+00:00,"That means; when you begin analysis you should already have a clear goal of the analysis, which problems you need to have answered and why"
4227,2021-10-07T08:23:11.478000+00:00,"UXR is applied research, in that sense it's different from academic research"
4228,2021-10-07T08:22:46.933000+00:00,"You're not on a fishing trip, trying to see which fish you can catch and present the fishes you caught"
4229,2021-10-07T08:19:03.018000+00:00,"It's not about whether you should be creating a persona, or whether you shouldn't. More so, which goals, needs and frustrations are you going to focus on specifically and why?"
4230,2021-10-07T08:17:27.189000+00:00,If I would be paying you; you need to be able to answer how your effort in presenting this information is going to be valuable for developing that product
4231,2021-10-07T08:14:48.913000+00:00,"You're not going to develop a product, you're going to develop a solution to a problem in the form of a product. But what is your focus? Which painpoints are you going to fix and why those?"
4232,2021-10-07T08:11:02.180000+00:00,"But to discover pain points, I'm not creating a persona for that.

For that I did interviews, and now just to put a perspective or to add context to the whole research I guess persona would be helpful"
4233,2021-10-07T08:08:36.398000+00:00,"I mean based upon the frustrations and goals I'm going to develop a product right?

That's the whole point of my research 

To discover pain points so that I can eliminate / try to reduce them.

So I'm going to design a product that will eliminate those pain points"
4234,2021-10-07T07:13:15.292000+00:00,"In this case we didn't really make a persona from it, because the information will just be in a slidedeck of insights, because this will be more useful for the person reading it"
4235,2021-10-07T07:12:08.331000+00:00,"Then a ""humanized experience"" probably isn't the most concrete way of saying this, but the point is, there needs to be a call to action based on each point of information you put in a persona, that has a clear consequence if you don't do it."
4236,2021-10-07T07:10:53.167000+00:00,"Practical example. Currently I'm doing something for a buying house process, software used by brokers and their clients. Here an interesting data point is; they prefer a personalised e-mail. In the design this means; when they get an e-mail that triggers the QR in which they can sign-up for the product. This e-mail uses the name of the broker, because if it doesn't, people no longer trust that the e-mail comes from a reliable source so they won't act on it because ""It could be a phishing e-mail"". 

So then we got a clear persona point ""Humanized experience"" meaning the product feels like it's coming from the broker you've talked and had contract with (even though it's a third party), consequence if you don't do this; people will no longer download the product because they won't trust it"
4237,2021-10-07T06:37:40.989000+00:00,"Even goals and frustrations, they don't mean a thing, if you don't know why you need it. Who cares about my frustration ""my dog keeps pooping in the living room"", if you're developing a product completely unrelated to that?"
4238,2021-10-07T06:35:46.862000+00:00,That specifically is much more important than the persona itself
4239,2021-10-07T06:35:28.110000+00:00,"So I guess what Kenny and Prototype are saying (I assume), is not that you shouldn't make a persona, it's that you need to know 'why' you need to know the specific information, for what reason, what is it going to be useful for, what can we do now that we couldn't do without the information?"
4240,2021-10-07T06:32:58.974000+00:00,"But even then, a picture of a country is such a limited way of showing what the country is like, you need to be very clear of which specific things you want to make photos"
4241,2021-10-07T06:31:33.185000+00:00,"Still in the realistic situation there are many stakeholders who need the info of the user, but will not do their own research. So for them the persona is especially valuable."
4242,2021-10-07T06:27:15.753000+00:00,"So if you say ""But then I wouldn't have defined ""who"" I'm designing for"" does that mean, if you didn't make a selfie you didn't really go on holiday?"
4243,2021-10-07T06:24:31.776000+00:00,Because everyone goes there every week
4244,2021-10-07T06:24:20.078000+00:00,But in the ideal situation nobody would need the photo
4245,2021-10-07T06:14:03.758000+00:00,But it‚Äôs just documentation
4246,2021-10-07T06:13:32.740000+00:00,The photo might show the trees are red where you‚Äôve been
4247,2021-10-07T06:13:09.108000+00:00,Which you can show others
4248,2021-10-07T06:12:48.517000+00:00,It‚Äôs just a reminder / proof of having been somewhere
4249,2021-10-07T06:12:23.122000+00:00,A persona is like a selfie on a holiday
4250,2021-10-07T05:26:27.910000+00:00,"In my case I think pointing out the frustration and goals of my potential user would help out yea. Which I can represent in the form of persona.

But do I need persona? What will happen if I don't create persona in my case?
Ans : Sure I can move ahead to ideating solutions with the existing research I've done so far. 
But then I wouldn't have defined ""who"" I'm designing for and "" why"" I'm designing this solution and for ""what"" reasons.

For that reason I think I might need persona?"
4251,2021-10-07T04:07:47.325000+00:00,"For me, I always like to have a persona, or at least a proto-persona created early on so that I can print it out and tape it up next to my desk. It serves as a reminder of who I am designing for, what their needs, goals, and frustrations are, and keeps me from diverting away from what my research has shown. It also helps me with my presentation at each stage--how is this relating to Pickle Smith's problem?

In my admittedly limited experience, I have seen a lot of people try to suggest there are singular, orthodox methods for UX but it all depends on the designer, the client, and the project itself. Are you going to be presenting your findings? Then think about the target audience of that presentation. Will it be a portfolio project? Then consider how you will tell the story of your process. If you don't think a persona is necessary then you don't need one. But like everything else we do, do your research so that you can justify whichever choice you make."
4252,2021-10-07T03:53:47.726000+00:00,"Ya I ""feel"" like making personas, but it's not like personas would have any impact on my research. I don't see getting anything out of the persona, except that I can display who I'm creating the solution for, their frustrations and goals"
4253,2021-10-07T03:50:53.110000+00:00,"So then when should we use personas? Or empathy maps?

 When I look up articles about them, it feels like I could use them in my case.

But again it's not like if I don't use persona or empathy map, my research would ""incomplete"".

I could just synthesize whatever info I have at this point and move forward to ideating solutions, but then why do we even need personas? Or empathy map? 

Like I don't see a very strong point to use them

Hope it makes sense what I'm trying to say"
4254,2021-10-07T03:44:27.822000+00:00,Hm yea I think I get it now. Ty
4255,2021-10-06T22:14:20.460000+00:00,"Hello üëã! Id love to collect some thoughts on recruiting participants.

I‚Äôm the sole UXR at a startup. There‚Äôs 9 of us in total at the company. We have about 150-300 active users (some more active than others) but I struggle getting participants for research.
- Whenever I reach out via email to a selection of users, hardly anyone opens the email.
- Most of our users work in sales or are entrepreneurs and use linkedin on a daily basis so I connect with them there and often use that as a way to ask them to test something, join me for an interview or a live user panel. This is very time consuming and the response rate is very low üòÖ

- We have built a slack community with those 300 users and they have joined but only a few ever post intros, react to posts or interact in some way.

Essentially I think most people use our product but don‚Äôt have an interest in helping build it. And that‚Äôs completely okay. But how can I improve my chances of getting users in my studies? We‚Äôve offered free subscriptions and longer trials but that doesn‚Äôt seem to be enough. Paying them might be possible in the future but not right now.
Does anyone here have insights and tips, or share the same experience?"
4256,2021-10-06T19:23:54.033000+00:00,"Especially with school projects, that often have no clear goals / consequences of not following these goals, because you're not the ones overseeing them"
4257,2021-10-06T19:19:40.141000+00:00,Doing useful research is much more difficult than doing the research itself
4258,2021-10-06T19:18:57.796000+00:00,Finding out you wasted a lot of time by going out of scope
4259,2021-10-06T19:18:47.495000+00:00,Though this is the kind of learn by going through the process a lot of times
4260,2021-10-06T19:09:52.894000+00:00,"So you can scope; what you want to do, what you need to know in order to do that, and lastly how you're going to display those findings, fitting for the person needing to use those findings."
4261,2021-10-06T19:07:44.658000+00:00,Good idea to create a research plan to
4262,2021-10-06T18:26:09.251000+00:00,is it because you feel like thats just the thing you should do? like Prototype said. What are you hoping to gain from the exercise
4263,2021-10-06T18:25:46.906000+00:00,do you need the personas or whats your reason for making personas

4265,2021-10-06T18:23:56.563000+00:00,"This is why I told you to start from ""What do you need to do the next step"". If you keep starting from ""Well I did this, what now"" your process is going to be a series of opening doors and hoping the right answer is behind them."
4266,2021-10-06T17:56:17.514000+00:00,Congrats!
4267,2021-10-06T17:55:59.608000+00:00,"Hmm in that case I guess we can't make empathy maps unless we direct observe users in their natural environment

Damn what should be my next step then after interviewing? Just synthesize the data from what I have observed user feels and thinks?"
4268,2021-10-06T17:40:12.871000+00:00,I was in interviews today all day about the subject
4269,2021-10-06T17:39:59.295000+00:00,Just so happens I‚Äôm also doing research for a brokers product!
4270,2021-10-06T17:38:35.922000+00:00,"high spike of stress on ""oH GOD I JUST PUT DOWN THE DOWN PAYMENT, WHAT HAVE I DONE?"""
4271,2021-10-06T17:38:10.983000+00:00,Can definitely imagine an empathy map about that process
4272,2021-10-06T17:37:54.515000+00:00,congrats! üòÑ
4273,2021-10-06T17:37:47.087000+00:00,I‚Äôm actually getting one
4274,2021-10-06T17:36:55.176000+00:00,is that an example of a quote during research or are you actually getting a house? üòÖ
4275,2021-10-06T17:36:27.396000+00:00,I will get the keys to a house next weeküóùÔ∏è
4276,2021-10-06T17:35:49.753000+00:00,As buying a house is definitely something you discuss with many people
4277,2021-10-06T17:35:08.956000+00:00,"Ah yes, can definitely see that, especially the part about ‚Äòwhat do other people say‚Äô"
4278,2021-10-06T17:34:40.330000+00:00,but I guess that's service/CX to an extent as well
4279,2021-10-06T17:34:18.993000+00:00,"yeah, and from there you could develop a product (including other research)"
4280,2021-10-06T17:33:53.743000+00:00,I think games in general blend that as well
4281,2021-10-06T17:33:52.041000+00:00,As in; a person looking for a home to buy?
4282,2021-10-06T17:32:56.824000+00:00,house buying research is the one that was passed around in fintech during product development a lot as an example
4283,2021-10-06T17:32:32.074000+00:00,Such an immersive product
4284,2021-10-06T17:32:22.678000+00:00,PokemonGo maybe?
4285,2021-10-06T17:32:16.513000+00:00,"Yeah, I imagine there are some very specific cases where this could be used in a UX sense as well"
4286,2021-10-06T17:31:04.373000+00:00,"I would say that's accurate most of the time, (but not all). Hard to empathy map the UX of like, ""submitting a weekly data refresh through x tool"", but much easier with like ""getting through to IT to reset your password"" (to add credence to your point)"
4287,2021-10-06T17:11:02.130000+00:00,"Also may help to know empathy maps are more valuable in service design and CX than UX.

Which I may be wrong about"
4288,2021-10-06T17:08:40.275000+00:00,I‚Äôm all about healthy eating when I‚Äôm rested and a fast-food king after working for 10 hours
4289,2021-10-06T17:07:53.551000+00:00,Which is why data from interviews often conflicts
4290,2021-10-06T17:07:23.284000+00:00,Because ‚Äòpersonality‚Äô is a fluid concept based on situation and context
4291,2021-10-06T17:06:03.518000+00:00,Which is why personas aren‚Äôt always effective
4292,2021-10-06T17:04:43.609000+00:00,https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empathy_gap
4293,2021-10-06T17:04:16.476000+00:00,This is called a cold empathy gap in psychology
4294,2021-10-06T17:03:57.099000+00:00,People are always in contrast about what they do. When they‚Äôre full of energy and it‚Äôs morning their ideas of their personalities are different from when they had a work day of 10 hours
4295,2021-10-06T17:01:13.909000+00:00,Then they do
4296,2021-10-06T17:01:09.191000+00:00,Then if you actually shadow these people in the train and make notes
4297,2021-10-06T17:00:50.766000+00:00,"If you found out through conversation what they do, they don‚Äôt do but say"
4298,2021-10-06T16:58:54.879000+00:00,"If you actually saw them doing it through observations, then it‚Äôs doing"
4299,2021-10-06T16:57:26.348000+00:00,You only know what they ‚Äòsay‚Äô not what they ‚Äòdo‚Äô
4300,2021-10-06T16:56:59.900000+00:00,Also in the context you got this information through interviews
4301,2021-10-06T16:54:41.236000+00:00,"Empathy maps are tools, they are not goals, they can be great when the context of this information is important"
4302,2021-10-06T16:53:59.093000+00:00,But also what prototype says
4303,2021-10-06T16:53:23.944000+00:00,"It‚Äôs not about picking one of these, it‚Äôs about finding out why they contrast"
4304,2021-10-06T16:52:33.712000+00:00,Contrasting data is in that sense actually the most valuable
4305,2021-10-06T16:51:57.993000+00:00,"In that sense if you got all the quotes and transcripts, it‚Äôs still important to analyse data and draw conclusions"
4306,2021-10-06T16:50:45.072000+00:00,Also keep in mind empathy maps define translated data
4307,2021-10-06T16:09:54.890000+00:00,Like to someone who will be viewing this project or maybe if I was working in a team for this project ( currently none) they would understand what's going on it by looking it
4308,2021-10-06T16:08:26.696000+00:00,"Ya true. But I kinda see the way that after making empathy maps, I could create personas based upon that empathy map to "" humanize"" the whole thing."
4309,2021-10-06T16:05:58.022000+00:00,the needs of your next step define what you do in this step.
4310,2021-10-06T16:05:46.114000+00:00,I guess my point is
4311,2021-10-06T16:05:17.111000+00:00,communicate them to who?
4312,2021-10-06T16:03:04.026000+00:00,"Hmm I feel like to communicate and prioritize user needs that I've found so far, from the two different user profiles identified, it would be good  to represent the findings in empathy maps.
I'm thinking of making 2 empathy maps to represent the two user profiles."
4313,2021-10-06T15:36:14.291000+00:00,Maybe you have to build a third empathy map. Maybe you dont need to build empathy maps.
4314,2021-10-06T15:36:02.337000+00:00,Do you need either of those data points?
4315,2021-10-06T15:35:49.048000+00:00,"I would stop starting with what you can possible do, and consider what you need to do."

4317,2021-10-06T15:01:07.335000+00:00,"Hi had another doubt regarding this empathy map:
So while interviewing I found out that the same person, while commuting, falls asleep, and sometimes tried to stay awake so they don't miss their stop
So in the empathy map should I include both of these conflicting behaviors under ""What are they doing"""
4318,2021-10-06T12:21:39.635000+00:00,Ok ty
4319,2021-10-06T12:02:00.364000+00:00,If you mix them the context no longer makes sense
4320,2021-10-06T12:01:28.381000+00:00,"So yes, different profile for students and working individuals"
4321,2021-10-06T11:58:44.663000+00:00,"In theory you want a persona, empathy map, user journey, scenarios all for the same 1 profile"
4322,2021-10-06T11:57:10.560000+00:00,It will be different than each color the moment you mix them
4323,2021-10-06T11:56:59.789000+00:00,It's like mixing two colors
4324,2021-10-06T11:56:52.463000+00:00,Never mix users in one profile
4325,2021-10-06T11:56:45.069000+00:00,"1 empathy map, for 1 profile"
4326,2021-10-06T08:24:42.649000+00:00,"Hi, had a question. I identified 2 user groups for a project that I'm working on:
1) Students
2) Working individuals
I have identified some common and unique characteristics for both of them.

I was thinking of making 2 empathy maps to articulate both user groups.

Or should I go with just 1 empathy map and just aggregate it all?

For me it makes more sense to make 2, and then create 2 personas based upon those empathy maps"

4332,2021-10-05T18:23:09.010000+00:00,Like this commentüòú
4333,2021-10-05T18:22:56.850000+00:00,"Triggering a person to give more info, eliciting techniques"
4334,2021-10-05T18:22:43.385000+00:00,"It‚Äôs leading yeah, but in the opposite direction"
4335,2021-10-05T18:21:47.144000+00:00,i'm confused..how is this anti-leading?
4336,2021-10-05T18:20:44.642000+00:00,Asking a vegetarian ‚ÄúWouldn‚Äôt it be great if we just all eat some more meat?‚Äù
4337,2021-10-05T18:19:40.686000+00:00,Just leading a question to something they know you don‚Äôt agree too just to trigger you <:FrogCool:851335403864195083>
4338,2021-10-05T18:19:06+00:00,Journalist always do anti-leading questions
4339,2021-10-05T16:59:14.220000+00:00,any leading question in research is useless <a:homerhide:601471730606931999>
4340,2021-10-05T16:58:35.007000+00:00,Or if you don't know how to ask questions on non-leading ways
4341,2021-10-05T05:55:09.191000+00:00,"Surveys in general are completely useless if you don‚Äôt know how to use them, especially for UX"
4342,2021-10-05T05:38:33.772000+00:00,"Even through interviews, it‚Äôs very difficult to discover the core JTBD, because often they'll tell you 20 JTBD's when there's only 1 core one."
4343,2021-10-05T05:36:27.064000+00:00,"But yes, they‚Äôre definitely far to complex to be discovered with a survey"
4344,2021-10-05T05:35:55.179000+00:00,https://youtu.be/sfGtw2C95Ms
4345,2021-10-05T05:35:52.475000+00:00,This is also an insightful video
4346,2021-10-05T05:34:13.113000+00:00,Though they can be very difficult
4347,2021-10-05T05:33:59.795000+00:00,Is pretty great
4348,2021-10-05T05:33:54.702000+00:00,https://youtu.be/HSyC7M6u4zQ
4349,2021-10-05T05:33:34.812000+00:00,You can get JTBD through specific interview techniques
4350,2021-10-05T03:41:47.032000+00:00,a survey is almost always going to be the wrong approach to extract meaningful insights about the behavior of people.
4351,2021-10-05T03:41:25.175000+00:00,"The world isnt technically that black and white, but for simplicity"
4352,2021-10-05T03:39:00.356000+00:00,No
4353,2021-10-05T03:04:32.695000+00:00,Can info from a jobs to be done interview be captured in a survey?
4354,2021-10-04T20:11:40.110000+00:00,Okay thanks <@!209640428151111680> . I moved my request for participants over to <#708809627260944436>
4355,2021-10-04T20:10:09.758000+00:00,Just not recruit participants
4356,2021-10-04T20:10:00.681000+00:00,<@!806776726205104129> feedback on survey questions & structure itself can be asked here though
4357,2021-10-04T19:09:17.702000+00:00,Got it. Thanks <@!598373085120299018>
4358,2021-10-04T19:08:18.473000+00:00,<#708809627260944436>
4359,2021-10-04T19:06:32.095000+00:00,"in general, UX people are not a good group of people to send surveys, unless the survey is specifically about being a UX person."
4360,2021-10-04T18:53:07.007000+00:00,"Hey all. Not exactly a newb to the group, but haven't been very active on Discord for a while. I'm a design student working through one of my 1st assignments & experiences w/ surveys. Is this a good place to ask for participants/responses & a little feedback? Thanks"
4361,2021-10-04T08:03:45.859000+00:00,Yup
4362,2021-10-04T08:02:33.930000+00:00,But the moment you share it it's very contextual to the person needing to use it
4363,2021-10-04T08:02:20.197000+00:00,So drafts can be as chaotic as you want
4364,2021-10-04T08:02:05.901000+00:00,More than often you're not going to be the only one using the research
4365,2021-10-04T08:01:52.407000+00:00,"Yeah, it kind of depends"
4366,2021-10-04T07:59:45.963000+00:00,"Idk I'm just assuming, never been in that scenario"
4367,2021-10-04T07:59:07.394000+00:00,"But I feel like its gonna be chaotic anyways. Even if it works fine for me,for someone else it'll be quite messy"
4368,2021-10-04T07:56:35.267000+00:00,Yea I'll give it a try. Excel sounds like a better option right now
4369,2021-10-04T07:55:56.391000+00:00,Boxes and charts usually work better
4370,2021-10-04T07:55:48.467000+00:00,"Yes, avoid to much lines"
4371,2021-10-04T07:55:27.852000+00:00,"I'm trynna figure out the best way to organize, but that again might depend on the complexity of the project itself I suppose. 
For eg: If there are lots of questions then I think a mind map will be too chaotic to present the data"
4372,2021-10-04T07:53:43.237000+00:00,Nice
4373,2021-10-04T07:52:44.498000+00:00,I've done something similar
4374,2021-10-04T07:52:23.625000+00:00,You could do that indeed
4375,2021-10-04T07:52:04.871000+00:00,Yea
4376,2021-10-04T07:51:50.671000+00:00,A mindmap?
4377,2021-10-04T07:51:34.647000+00:00,It will always be chaos
4378,2021-10-04T07:51:31.466000+00:00,I see. Right now I was thinking of arranging it like this :
4379,2021-10-04T07:51:29.158000+00:00,As you can see
4380,2021-10-04T07:50:53.520000+00:00,This is a maze preperation
4381,2021-10-04T07:50:23.520000+00:00,Then screens are pasted
4382,2021-10-04T07:50:18.523000+00:00,Where each scenario is a sequence of blocks
4383,2021-10-04T07:49:59.105000+00:00,
4384,2021-10-04T07:49:43.087000+00:00,Oh nope that's not a prototype test
4385,2021-10-04T07:48:05.497000+00:00,Example; prototype test could be something like this
4386,2021-10-04T07:47:55.255000+00:00,"So it's very contextual depending on who is going to use it, depending how it needs to be structured"
4387,2021-10-04T07:47:34.488000+00:00,I'm just presenting research and recommendations
4388,2021-10-04T07:47:17.413000+00:00,The difference though is that I'm not the one using my research
4389,2021-10-04T07:46:41.754000+00:00,Usually I put them in a report asap
4390,2021-10-04T07:46:23.678000+00:00,Yea
4391,2021-10-04T07:45:58.039000+00:00,So each project it can be different because they are with different people each time
4392,2021-10-04T07:45:42.696000+00:00,I see
4393,2021-10-04T07:45:29.479000+00:00,"If my team mates do it differently, I need to follow their lead"
4394,2021-10-04T07:45:18.347000+00:00,I think the main difference is that how I organise is not always my own choice
4395,2021-10-04T07:44:47.181000+00:00,"Even in Miro how do you organize it? coz from this pic, it seems  like I can organize these as stickies, and connect them"
4396,2021-10-04T07:43:27.804000+00:00,I use Miro and notion
4397,2021-10-04T07:42:03.934000+00:00,"Also if you don't use Atomic research, how do you organize the data then?

Is there any other way? Because the atomic model seemed pretty intuitive to me

Also do you see any cons with the atomic research model?"
4398,2021-10-04T07:40:34.597000+00:00,Yea this is nice
4399,2021-10-04T07:01:33.756000+00:00,With some picture of data or quote of user
4400,2021-10-04T06:58:36.481000+00:00,"Usually something like
[Insight Statement]
[Insight Statement]
[Insight Statement]
Recommendation"
4401,2021-10-04T06:57:52.088000+00:00,"Yeah, for easy presenting I just put it in a report early on"
4402,2021-10-04T06:31:54.267000+00:00,Nice thanks!
4403,2021-10-04T06:20:37.577000+00:00,Haven‚Äôt actually used that myself
4404,2021-10-04T06:19:59.606000+00:00,https://consider.ly/blog/atomic-ux-research/
4405,2021-10-04T06:19:56.920000+00:00,Also look at atomic research
4406,2021-10-04T06:17:27.327000+00:00,Miro verse may have some inspo for that: https://miro.com/miroverse/
4407,2021-10-04T06:16:48.613000+00:00,"Miro or Mural often for client sessions, observation sessions or any post it related thing. They key is working in pre-defined structures in miro"
4408,2021-10-04T04:01:54.973000+00:00,Also how would you present the results in a simpler way?
4409,2021-10-04T04:01:00.760000+00:00,"Organizing the data. Yea Miro is helpful but I was wondering what UXR professionals use.
I guess Miro still works"
4410,2021-10-03T19:50:21.969000+00:00,"you know, typical millennial"
4411,2021-10-03T19:50:15.903000+00:00,Mostly I want to feel I have purpose.
4412,2021-10-03T19:49:31.372000+00:00,"I actually have no preference so long as I feel engaged, challenged, and can research/develop cool stuff üòÖ"
4413,2021-10-03T19:09:53.895000+00:00,Do you prefer agency or inhouse?
4414,2021-10-03T19:09:41.347000+00:00,I suppose make sense too
4415,2021-10-03T18:39:38.804000+00:00,"yeah, I do remember that in agency where we had to release a project that could have been made stronger, but client timeline didn't allow us that. That's usually *less* of a restriction in-house, but not completely gone, per say."
4416,2021-10-03T18:38:52.559000+00:00,Only to end it in a few weeks/months for several other ones
4417,2021-10-03T18:38:34.705000+00:00,Can be overwhelming to keep juggling 3/4 different contexts all the time though
4418,2021-10-03T18:38:13.527000+00:00,Yeah you just move on to other products
4419,2021-10-03T18:37:20.269000+00:00,"yeah, see that's the dream XD"
4420,2021-10-03T18:37:10.827000+00:00,And end with a report
4421,2021-10-03T18:37:09.098000+00:00,"Yeah, that's basically the gist of it; though I found the long iteration time a bit frustrating on the big data project since the project kept changing directions.'"
4422,2021-10-03T18:37:01.198000+00:00,I usually just get an X amount of days to present each deliverable
4423,2021-10-03T18:36:23.862000+00:00,"at my current job, we have a chatbot launch we need to launch in two months, if we do iterate beyond that, it's because my boss wants me to, not because I specifically work in house"
4424,2021-10-03T18:36:23.229000+00:00,Seems like you need to be lucky with the company then!
4425,2021-10-03T18:35:38.738000+00:00,At c1 our big data product was iterating for months
4426,2021-10-03T18:35:02.119000+00:00,"I'm inhouse, this is kinda a yes and no question. Basically your client will be by department, and each department/product has a deadline. Some teams do keep iterating, some don't (since time is $$$); depends on what project you are on. There is, however, more wiggle room to explore a bit more."
4427,2021-10-03T18:33:52.234000+00:00,"Do you mean organizing the raw data, or presenting the results/conclusions in a simple way?"
4428,2021-10-03T18:31:40.892000+00:00,Personally I still do Miro and Notion all the way
4429,2021-10-03T18:29:09.645000+00:00,Though that‚Äôs just another sea of data tbh
4430,2021-10-03T18:28:58.427000+00:00,Some do atomic research
4431,2021-10-03T18:03:33.942000+00:00,"Hi, how do you yall organize the data collected from interviews and surveys?
Previously I used to just make affinity maps in Miro, but I wonder if there's any better way or tool, so that I don't get lost in the sea of data."
4432,2021-10-03T11:11:39.901000+00:00,Oh ok
4433,2021-10-03T11:08:24.718000+00:00,"I've never worked inhouse though, so that's my assumption"
4434,2021-10-03T10:59:09.248000+00:00,"Sort of yeah; with an agency the product is always client side. So when the research is finished, you pass it on to the client, what happens with it is their responsibility. So you don't always get very deep. It's outsourced. 

While with in house (though I don't have experience with this) you as UXR can keep iterating for as long you're hired. So you can get much deeper and spent more time on very specific things."
4435,2021-10-03T10:52:19.489000+00:00,"What do you mean by inhouse roles? Like research within company iteself?

Did you mean if the research is led by the employees within the company itself then they might be allowed to continue research, but if they outsource using research agencies their request might get rejected. 

Did you mean that?"
4436,2021-10-03T10:09:20.531000+00:00,Otherwise UXR would be quite exclusive
4437,2021-10-03T10:04:30.876000+00:00,So even if you‚Äôre much smaller than google or FB
4438,2021-10-03T10:03:41.488000+00:00,Generally with inhouse roles you can usually continue I suppose
4439,2021-10-03T09:46:50.643000+00:00,Also might come down to how much you can convince the stakeholders to continue research
4440,2021-10-03T09:45:01.743000+00:00,"Yea i feel like this might be only done in big companies like Google, Fb etc"
4441,2021-10-03T09:42:55.484000+00:00,Though often there's no budget for that
4442,2021-10-03T09:41:13.680000+00:00,Hmm yea
4443,2021-10-03T09:40:14.870000+00:00,Why does X & Y contrast?
4444,2021-10-03T09:40:08.614000+00:00,That could become the new research question / goal
4445,2021-10-03T09:38:03.401000+00:00,Do more research and find out why this happens
4446,2021-10-03T09:37:15.097000+00:00,Hm yea. What would be the next move when quali and quanti data contrast each other?
4447,2021-10-03T09:28:38.472000+00:00,"Thanks, that‚Äôs really helpful! I just wanted to hear first hand that it‚Äôs a good product. Have you also used it for surveys?"
4448,2021-10-03T09:19:39.453000+00:00,"You just give a set of characteristics, and demographics (or a mix in) and they'll find people for you in a few weeks"
4449,2021-10-03T09:19:00.342000+00:00,Works pretty great I suppose
4450,2021-10-03T09:15:27.066000+00:00,What kind of feedback do you want?
4451,2021-10-03T09:15:19.538000+00:00,We use https://respondenten.nl/ yes
4452,2021-10-03T09:14:16.577000+00:00,"Hello üëãüèº 
For a UX research job I‚Äôm considering using a tool like Respondent or UserInterviews.com. Has anyone used either platform or anything similar? I‚Äôd really appreciate input, advice or feedback. Thanks!"
4453,2021-10-03T09:00:14.030000+00:00,"(quantitive being taste tests, qualitative being interviews)"
4454,2021-10-03T08:59:47.076000+00:00,So then the qualitative and quantitative contrast each other
4455,2021-10-03T08:58:11.968000+00:00,But in reality it turns out it's creamy and milky coffee (starbucks)
4456,2021-10-03T08:57:53.426000+00:00,It's al dark and black coffee
4457,2021-10-03T08:57:47.767000+00:00,Or if you do qualitative research about how people want their coffee
4458,2021-10-03T08:55:56.368000+00:00,But in qualitative research they'll tell you exactly how different they taste
4459,2021-10-03T08:55:41.826000+00:00,If you do taste tests people won't notice the difference
4460,2021-10-03T08:55:33.087000+00:00,Beer tasting is a fun example
4461,2021-10-03T08:55:12.780000+00:00,"Yeah it's quite interesting, many big examples where people did not triangulate enough and costed millions/billions"
4462,2021-10-03T07:39:21.450000+00:00,Yep
4463,2021-10-02T17:41:39.180000+00:00,From the perspective of triangulation
4464,2021-10-02T17:41:31.671000+00:00,It's just a good way to write an insight
4465,2021-10-02T17:39:35.669000+00:00,That part isn't that important though
4466,2021-10-02T17:39:27.672000+00:00,"Yeah, but more as in; an observation by itself isn't yet a insight"
4467,2021-10-02T17:30:11.179000+00:00,Didn't understand what you meant here. We gain insights from observations right?
4468,2021-10-02T17:26:00.810000+00:00,"Or ""User observation"""
4469,2021-10-02T17:25:54.282000+00:00,"It's the difference between an ""User insight"""
4470,2021-10-02T17:25:45.253000+00:00,Yup exactly
4471,2021-10-02T17:24:19.238000+00:00,"I see. So it's basically all just digging deeper into the "" why"" of everything"
4472,2021-10-02T17:23:57.262000+00:00,And you may find it it's just green baby ducks
4473,2021-10-02T17:23:31.570000+00:00,Then you need to find out why there isn't a difference
4474,2021-10-02T17:23:20.858000+00:00,"Yup, because it may turn out the A/B test suddenly fails"
4475,2021-10-02T17:21:04.299000+00:00,"Ah so in this context :
Vertex 1 : outside perspective
Vertex 2 and 3: A/ B test with and without baby duck"
4476,2021-10-02T17:19:21.146000+00:00,"Nngroup isn't the best example, since they've just done their own research"
4477,2021-10-02T17:17:46.092000+00:00,It's still basically the same thing
4478,2021-10-02T17:17:40.070000+00:00,But I suppose if you suddenly take 2 or 5 points
4479,2021-10-02T17:17:21.358000+00:00,Then you have a triangle of research; telling you things from different perspectives
4480,2021-10-02T17:16:56.315000+00:00,"So then you do A / B testing, one with baby ducks, another without"
4481,2021-10-02T17:16:20.553000+00:00,So then you test that with people; and suddenly you'll see the cuteness of the baby ducks transcends to the product
4482,2021-10-02T17:15:53.806000+00:00,They say picture of baby ducks increase conversion
4483,2021-10-02T17:15:40.369000+00:00,Ya
4484,2021-10-02T17:15:38.095000+00:00,Imagine reading some NNGroup article (or some paper)
4485,2021-10-02T17:15:18.824000+00:00,So existing research / desk / could already say the same thing
4486,2021-10-02T17:15:02.953000+00:00,Yeah indeed
4487,2021-10-02T17:14:54.823000+00:00,Though not really a triangle because there are two points
4488,2021-10-02T17:14:53.200000+00:00,I think I said indirect also coz usually when I think triangulation - > triangle - > 3 components
4489,2021-10-02T17:14:42.286000+00:00,It's basically direct triangulation (afaik)
4490,2021-10-02T17:13:31.186000+00:00,"Hm idk my idea of triangulation is still blurry. Like it's supposed to be mixture of quanti and quali or rather mixing different methodologies to get the best insights.

I think I said indirect coz I might have thought this card sort + usability testing ( quali and quanti) is a subset of triangulation"
4491,2021-10-02T17:10:04.243000+00:00,Why indirectly?
4492,2021-10-02T17:09:34.387000+00:00,"So let's say we do card sort to make the IA and then test the prototype using maze.

So all this is indirectly triangulation?"
4493,2021-10-02T17:09:12.664000+00:00,"Yes, because just because they told you the ""Why"" doesn't mean that ""Why"" is actually true"
4494,2021-10-02T17:08:28.803000+00:00,Oh so we are validating our evaluations right?
4495,2021-10-02T17:03:37.085000+00:00,Then the quantitative way you're putting it to the test to and will literally see a number of success rate of many people
4496,2021-10-02T17:02:50.389000+00:00,"The qualitative way would be to do cardsorting, to get the best information architecture down"
4497,2021-10-02T17:01:50.243000+00:00,
4498,2021-10-02T17:01:47.896000+00:00,With maze your data looks like this
4499,2021-10-02T17:01:00.369000+00:00,"You validate the 'why' but the why itself is evaluation, not validating"
4500,2021-10-02T17:00:31.861000+00:00,So it's again that idea of triangulation
4501,2021-10-02T16:58:16.961000+00:00,"Maze is not just unmoderated, it's a quantitive way (mostly) to gain insights into a prototype"
4502,2021-10-02T16:57:38.191000+00:00,It's not so much about unmoderated vs moderated but quantified vs qualitative data
4503,2021-10-02T16:04:31.704000+00:00,"How? eventually the goals are the same right? Like I don't see why I'd specifically wanna do unmoderated to ""validate"" & not necessarily evaluate, I feel like both unmoderated and moderated are going to evaluate & validate the designs."
4504,2021-10-02T16:01:02.618000+00:00,hmmm
4505,2021-10-02T16:00:44.146000+00:00,"Yeah; I once heard someone say; moderated usability testing is *evaluating* a product, though more quantitative like maze or usability hub is *validating*"
4506,2021-10-02T15:59:41.753000+00:00,I think I'll settle with moderated usability testing XD
4507,2021-10-02T15:59:35.937000+00:00,"You can also recruit people yourself, then it's a lot cheaper"
4508,2021-10-02T15:59:15.949000+00:00,Euro
4509,2021-10-02T15:59:14.466000+00:00,(with the recruiting feature)
4510,2021-10-02T15:59:04.215000+00:00,100 usd?
4511,2021-10-02T15:58:54.414000+00:00,I think we often pay 100 for 1 test with 25 people
4512,2021-10-02T15:58:41.977000+00:00,However it's free to some extent
4513,2021-10-02T15:58:29.455000+00:00,Then you get a heatmap of where everyone clicked
4514,2021-10-02T15:58:19.997000+00:00,"Yeah, it works in 'missions', so you can for example ask ""Where would you click to find X?"""
4515,2021-10-02T15:57:06.301000+00:00,see
4516,2021-10-02T15:57:04.422000+00:00,I se
4517,2021-10-02T15:56:47.600000+00:00,So you can create certain 'interaction routes' and see the success rate of each
4518,2021-10-02T15:56:26.995000+00:00,But in maze you can quantify a lot
4519,2021-10-02T15:56:18.596000+00:00,"There's also usability hub, which is quite similar"
4520,2021-10-02T15:54:56.022000+00:00,Validating usability test especially
4521,2021-10-02T15:54:43.550000+00:00,usability testing etc?
4522,2021-10-02T15:54:33.947000+00:00,Maze is usually used for a little other contexts
4523,2021-10-02T15:54:27.788000+00:00,hmmm
4524,2021-10-02T15:54:26.166000+00:00,Ya paid
4525,2021-10-02T15:53:50.359000+00:00,https://www.alchemer.com/
4526,2021-10-02T15:53:49.653000+00:00,"Though, probably not free"
4527,2021-10-02T15:53:30.662000+00:00,For surveys we usually use Alchemer
4528,2021-10-02T15:52:57.489000+00:00,"I've heard about maze, not sure if its free, lemme check it"
4529,2021-10-02T15:52:10.583000+00:00,"or 5, have to check"
4530,2021-10-02T15:51:58.574000+00:00,I have put 4 sections so far
4531,2021-10-02T15:51:37.870000+00:00,Anything else you guys would recommend?
4532,2021-10-02T15:51:28.319000+00:00,"It does allow some logic, can make it go to different pages based on multiple-choice answers to a question. It can get unwieldy if you try to do too much logic. I've mainly used it to kick people under 18 out."
4533,2021-10-02T15:51:25.645000+00:00,"It does, like moves to a different section based upon choice"
4534,2021-10-02T13:43:05.110000+00:00,Not sure if google form allows logic questions
4535,2021-10-02T11:14:19.978000+00:00,"I think I can break this question down into 2 question:
1st question :
Is there something try to do to not miss your stop? ""yes"" ""no""

Then if ""yes"", I can insert that original question"
4536,2021-10-02T11:05:12.129000+00:00,"I feel like this option could have a negative undertone. 
I thought of replacing it with ""Nothing"", but again that might not be suitable.

Thoughts?"
4537,2021-10-01T23:35:41.190000+00:00,Wait until the user stories are ‚Äúa business is able to‚Ä¶‚Äù and you‚Äôll be yearning for personas
4538,2021-10-01T22:01:17.554000+00:00,Though in theory I‚Äôve never once created a useful persona
4539,2021-10-01T22:00:44.591000+00:00,Value propositions are nice though
4540,2021-10-01T21:54:12.541000+00:00,like just stop. everyone stop.
4541,2021-10-01T21:54:08.909000+00:00,lets just stop creating personas at the beginning of projects in general.
4542,2021-10-01T21:05:27.559000+00:00,Let alone making serious ux decisions
4543,2021-10-01T21:05:06.190000+00:00,3 people does not make for a good reference for creating user personas
4544,2021-10-01T21:04:48.424000+00:00,Yeahhhhh my training as a biomedical engineer lets me know sample size and yeah...
4545,2021-10-01T20:16:08.294000+00:00,senior researcher obv (i am joking pls do not think that senior researchers do this)
4546,2021-10-01T20:14:34.706000+00:00,"i've seen worst,"" talked to 1 person and came up with 3 personas"""
4547,2021-10-01T20:14:09.751000+00:00,"<:worrysob:864995049569386556> ""i conducted 3 interviews and came up with 3personas"""
4548,2021-10-01T20:04:07.727000+00:00,Her bootcamp one is good
4549,2021-10-01T19:55:51.995000+00:00,"I learned things, and im big dum"
4550,2021-10-01T19:55:45.360000+00:00,"Honestly, her advice is pretty solid for non-researchers too!"
4551,2021-10-01T17:48:35.133000+00:00,i encourage people to watch her videos if you are a junior or just starting out as a ux researcher
4552,2021-10-01T17:48:00.280000+00:00,https://www.youtube.com/c/AonaTalks/videos
4553,2021-10-01T08:05:40.733000+00:00,yeah true
4554,2021-10-01T07:54:01.655000+00:00,"Yeah, lots of emotional questions are best gained through indirect interview questions"
4555,2021-10-01T07:40:45.750000+00:00,thanks for the suggestion Dario. I appreciate it
4556,2021-10-01T07:31:51.375000+00:00,I suppose these kind of questions are better for face to face interviews
4557,2021-10-01T07:27:03.241000+00:00,"i feel this question is very absurd and vague. what do u have to say about the same, does it sounds legit to you?"
4558,2021-10-01T07:26:41.733000+00:00,
4559,2021-10-01T06:42:01.566000+00:00,"Awesome, thanks for the resources."

4561,2021-10-01T06:37:30.947000+00:00,A very nice interview that's fun for e-commerce is this:
4562,2021-10-01T06:37:02.857000+00:00,Drivers in depth user interviews (JTBD if E-commerce)
4563,2021-10-01T06:36:24.694000+00:00,Barriers are a good case for usability testing
4564,2021-10-01T06:35:09.536000+00:00,
4565,2021-10-01T06:35:07.913000+00:00,The things you can uncover in UXR are these things:
4566,2021-10-01T06:34:38.626000+00:00,So I suppose it's sort of combining the two
4567,2021-10-01T06:34:27.823000+00:00,User centric approach to hotjar
4568,2021-10-01T06:33:48.859000+00:00,https://www.hotjar.com/conversion-rate-optimization/
4569,2021-10-01T06:33:15.992000+00:00,Hotjar got a nice page abotu CRO too
4570,2021-10-01T06:31:05.264000+00:00,I'm off to read about your suggestions.
4571,2021-10-01T06:31:04.212000+00:00,No problem!
4572,2021-10-01T06:30:56.770000+00:00,Thanks Dario!!
4573,2021-10-01T06:30:49.484000+00:00,üëå
4574,2021-10-01T06:30:37.663000+00:00,"Okay, but I think you've still given me a ton of great info, so thank you for that."
4575,2021-10-01T06:30:18.204000+00:00,Can't tell you a step to step guide about what to do though
4576,2021-10-01T06:29:31.509000+00:00,Let them sit in with the user test possibly; with lookback you can do that
4577,2021-10-01T06:29:14.181000+00:00,and set up a test day where you may do user test with 6 people in 1 day
4578,2021-10-01T06:28:57.268000+00:00,Let client cover costs (when they want real users)
4579,2021-10-01T06:28:31.007000+00:00,You get some recruitment agency
4580,2021-10-01T06:28:20.316000+00:00,Gotcha
4581,2021-10-01T06:28:06.923000+00:00,Real user contact is always the best - if that hasn't been done a lot before
4582,2021-10-01T06:27:41.116000+00:00,No that's good
4583,2021-10-01T06:27:24.447000+00:00,even to the extent of running user interviews or is that just way too much work for a potentially one-off client?
4584,2021-10-01T06:27:20.667000+00:00,"You want to know your users incentives, pains, JTBD's when going through the product."
4585,2021-10-01T06:26:42.465000+00:00,"Terms like persona, journeys, scenarios aside"
4586,2021-10-01T06:26:22.388000+00:00,You still essentially do all things you can to 'understand the user'
4587,2021-10-01T06:26:10.491000+00:00,Hmm  I see
4588,2021-10-01T06:25:37.220000+00:00,The CRO data could just be nice to validate certain choices
4589,2021-10-01T06:25:17.206000+00:00,"Well you can; just like you'd always do UXR, with or without CRO doesn't make a difference in how you work with that"
4590,2021-10-01T06:24:23.747000+00:00,and more so about usability
4591,2021-10-01T06:24:17.267000+00:00,"Hmm ok, so it's not so much user-specific research then"
4592,2021-10-01T06:24:12.837000+00:00,Because they always come from client side
4593,2021-10-01T06:24:06.782000+00:00,We don't have CRO specialist where I work
4594,2021-10-01T06:23:52.408000+00:00,I guess just work together? There's not really a magic way to combine it. You could do tons of usability / hotjar / maze tests.
4595,2021-10-01T06:22:01.815000+00:00,"how to combine UX and CRO... you've written told me a lot but now that I've written out the larger, picture, I'm wondering if there's any comment you'd like to make about that."
4596,2021-10-01T06:21:25.514000+00:00,"Anyway, the source of all my questions is that my friend who has exp doing all of this CRO related stuff wants to team up with me since I have some UX exp to offer some services to small ecommerce clients. I'm just wondering what sort of services would actually make sense"
4597,2021-10-01T06:21:20.425000+00:00,"Probably not, but then there‚Äôs still a lot of other ways to increase sales / conversions"
4598,2021-10-01T06:19:11.176000+00:00,hmmm I wonder how it would work in the case of working with smaller companies of less than say... 5 employees. They wouldn't have their own CRO inhouse.
4599,2021-10-01T06:18:05.317000+00:00,Journeymaps and personas don‚Äôt really matter all that much in just optimizing usability
4600,2021-10-01T06:17:14.769000+00:00,"Nope, it‚Äôs just that creating more ‚Äòvalue‚Äô making the experience better increases conversion too, but it‚Äôs indirect"
4601,2021-10-01T06:15:29.578000+00:00,"Well most companies have CRO inhouse, it‚Äôs not really (afaik) something you spend on an agency or freelancer"
4602,2021-10-01T06:15:25.826000+00:00,"Perhaps just a simple usability audit..? Create personas, journeymaps, and flows..?"
4603,2021-10-01T06:14:13.691000+00:00,so I'm wondering.. let's say as a freelance UX person who has ecommerce clients who all more or less some increase in a metric ultimately related to conversion. What is the extent of the type of work a UX person would do for these clients?
4604,2021-10-01T06:14:02.189000+00:00,Right
4605,2021-10-01T06:13:43.686000+00:00,It‚Äôs based on a lot of analytic tools
4606,2021-10-01T06:13:23.355000+00:00,As in it can take months/years to set up
4607,2021-10-01T06:12:41.335000+00:00,What do you mean by consistent work?
4608,2021-10-01T06:12:33.746000+00:00,And a lot of consistent work
4609,2021-10-01T06:12:22.260000+00:00,CRO is sales funnel theory
4610,2021-10-01T06:11:52.268000+00:00,Well UX increases CRO but CRO doesn‚Äôt increase UX
4611,2021-10-01T06:11:16.844000+00:00,"I ask because I have a friend who believes conversion rate optimization goes hand in hand with UX, but with my limited UX bootcamp knowledge, I'm unsure of how they work together."
4612,2021-10-01T06:10:24.338000+00:00,Where do you see the intersection of UX and increasing metrics in ecommerce?
4613,2021-10-01T06:09:50.166000+00:00,"Ah, I see"
4614,2021-10-01T06:09:29.560000+00:00,"So just with the years and books and working, being interested in it"
4615,2021-10-01T06:09:06.327000+00:00,I‚Äôm very interested in behavioral influence related to design. Also partly did my graduation project about behavioral nudging
4616,2021-10-01T06:06:00.238000+00:00,"also, I'm curious how you learned about this too?"
4617,2021-10-01T06:05:54.051000+00:00,ooo ok i have much to read about then
4618,2021-10-01T06:05:33.664000+00:00,And understanding why exactly the ‚ÄúJob to be done‚Äù of the product
4619,2021-10-01T06:05:08.735000+00:00,Selling more at once is more about framing and anchoring
4620,2021-10-01T06:04:51.577000+00:00,okay sure
4621,2021-10-01T06:04:44.187000+00:00,Take a look at prospect theory
4622,2021-10-01T06:04:32.903000+00:00,Hmm I see
4623,2021-10-01T06:04:24.340000+00:00,Yeah it‚Äôs not really UX though
4624,2021-10-01T06:04:05.321000+00:00,"Through this question, I'm also wondering about the role of UX in ecommerce marketing/sales things."
4625,2021-10-01T06:03:50.615000+00:00,"That‚Äôs more sales related I suppose. So tons of existing theory about that, especially behavioral economics.

But a more ux way would be getting down to the bottom why people need this item; which could be JTBD interviews"
4626,2021-10-01T06:02:13.263000+00:00,"On a side note, having just come out of a UX bootcamp, we're just creating apps without any metrics... so learning about how to think about increasing metrics is really interesting for me."
4627,2021-10-01T05:59:28.229000+00:00,"Yes, we want to get customers to purchase more than 1 in their first purchase"
4628,2021-10-01T05:59:04.257000+00:00,"Just asking, so multiple items in one purchase?"
4629,2021-10-01T05:49:21.773000+00:00,"Wait are you asking me, or are you telling me those questions as a way of thinking about this problem?"
4630,2021-10-01T05:48:44.599000+00:00,The goal is to increase the quantity that people are buying when they make their first purchase.
4631,2021-10-01T05:47:35.718000+00:00,What do you mean by patterns? Like how they browse via heatmaps..?
4632,2021-10-01T05:37:00.845000+00:00,"What are your current goals? As in, what questions are you hoping to get answered? Just how to increase conversion?"
4633,2021-10-01T05:36:31.239000+00:00,"Reviews can be a nice start for desk research. Finding some patterns you can explore, but it‚Äôs never really enough to do just that (though still better than nothing)

A tip is to not think with a persona in mind. Persona is not the goal, it‚Äôs just a tool for sharing understanding of the user."
4634,2021-10-01T05:22:50.923000+00:00,"For an ecommerce site, is creating user personas based solely on user reviews (400 ) ""enough"" research to think about ways to increase purchase order values? Or should I insist on doing additional research? And if so, what would additional research look like?"

4651,2021-09-28T13:50:56.353000+00:00,it's nice reading though! I'm just thinking less options in survey after form filling will reduce an already probably high cognitive load.
4652,2021-09-28T13:50:54.152000+00:00,No idea if there's more recent things
4653,2021-09-28T13:50:38.503000+00:00,But yes likert is from 1932 or so

4657,2021-09-28T13:48:33.326000+00:00,and most of them are done in like the 1940's?
4658,2021-09-28T13:48:25.074000+00:00,being the most recent
4659,2021-09-28T13:48:18.649000+00:00,you mean sources like
4660,2021-09-28T13:48:18.069000+00:00,Yeah well not using the SUS one

4662,2021-09-28T13:46:25.504000+00:00,I thought Sus was already super inaccurate
4663,2021-09-28T13:45:35.817000+00:00,"what how is that a ""good"" questionnaire for participants to answer"
4664,2021-09-28T13:44:41.252000+00:00,"Can you link me to some research on that? Personally not fond of number scaling, but that's due to my own personal bias of how much I hate answering them myself, Im aware. üòÖ"

4667,2021-09-28T13:42:15.877000+00:00,Liker scale of 7 points is known to be the most accurate
4668,2021-09-28T13:41:57.266000+00:00,Mhhh bit harder to quantify that
4669,2021-09-28T13:41:34.483000+00:00,"Yeah, it's not the most pretty design. Easily fixable though"
4670,2021-09-28T13:41:13.727000+00:00,Could always break the scale into just low/med/high?
4671,2021-09-28T13:26:05.067000+00:00,the questionaire itself is giving me so much cognitive load <:kek:801854563460186171>
4672,2021-09-28T13:22:40.251000+00:00,"Yeah, that's definitely a good idea. To notice any delays that happen"
4673,2021-09-28T13:16:15.723000+00:00,"anyways, I'm thinking maybe time spent on each question or time on task could be an interesting measure depending on how you want to use it."

4675,2021-09-28T13:15:44.800000+00:00,huh! Didn't know that! Smaller pupil = higher load?
4676,2021-09-28T13:15:42.171000+00:00,Though I don't have that gear üòÇ
4677,2021-09-28T13:15:25.117000+00:00,As pupil constriction can be used to measure cognitive load funny enough
4678,2021-09-28T13:15:06.261000+00:00,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_of_Variables_of_Attention
4679,2021-09-28T13:14:22.317000+00:00,I know cognitive load can be measured with infrared cameras too
4680,2021-09-28T13:14:09.087000+00:00,I don't think I know that one
4681,2021-09-28T13:13:41.956000+00:00,I think the test is called TOVA?
4682,2021-09-28T13:13:15.010000+00:00,My brain is specifically thinking of ADHD testing where they make you watch a flashing screen for 20 minutes and then measure response time.
4683,2021-09-28T13:12:14.360000+00:00,"Yeah, it's kind of a catch 22 there, and idk of a good solve unless you can interpret the data through response patterns and see if fatigue is hitting there (like if they hit mid-ground on everything...but you know what they say about assumptions...).

Maybe building in a break at the halfway period and doing the survey at beginning/middle/end?

Ah...yeah 5 questions might not be enough for them to zone out, so you might be covered."
4684,2021-09-28T13:11:25.164000+00:00,It would be max 5 questions though
4685,2021-09-28T13:11:17.320000+00:00,Ao that I can fill in the survey myself at the end
4686,2021-09-28T13:10:57.063000+00:00,"Maybe could even ask them verbally, but not sure how accurate that would be"
4687,2021-09-28T13:10:28.933000+00:00,But since it's always done at that specific moment the worse effect still lives in its own context if doing it again in future test
4688,2021-09-28T13:09:31.727000+00:00,"But yes, making them fill forms after forms might make the effect worse"
4689,2021-09-28T13:09:13.811000+00:00,"I think in the last 10 minutes of the test, as a reflection. I thought maybe first letting them pick a scale for each specific points within a minute for the first impression. Then maybe after they filled it in asking them to further validate the answer."
4690,2021-09-28T13:06:37.035000+00:00,"(Not saying that's what will happen, just something that's been rattling around in my brain for the past 24 hours) <@!209640428151111680>"
4691,2021-09-28T13:06:13.316000+00:00,"I have a question/consideration about your research: Have you thought of asking/using your survey questions after a specific time in your test? The only reason I'm asking is giving a survey after a form-filling task is a bit like having them fill out more forms, and am wondering if you get slightly more inaccurate answers that way if given directly post-test. ü§î"
4692,2021-09-28T13:00:23.760000+00:00,"Thanks, I'll look into the NASA thing!"
4693,2021-09-28T13:00:07.858000+00:00,That you can than score in the end
4694,2021-09-28T12:59:27.247000+00:00,7 point likert scale
4695,2021-09-28T12:59:17.937000+00:00,"Yeah, I see a lot use a 7 point system too"
4696,2021-09-28T12:58:45.956000+00:00,That's something that it's been used before and it has been really helpful. There are individual questions that you use in order to determine what those final scores are. The annoying thing is that the NASA TLX is easier to do with pen an paper than on a computer
4697,2021-09-28T12:57:48.656000+00:00,Yup
4698,2021-09-28T12:57:32.995000+00:00,This?

4716,2021-09-27T16:07:35.524000+00:00,That could work!
4717,2021-09-27T16:07:27.404000+00:00,"Fair! I'm thinking these things just off the cuff:
- Is there form fatigue?
- Do they know where they are at and what progress they're making in the form?
- Does the question flow make sense?
- Do they understand what each question is about?"
4718,2021-09-27T16:06:34.656000+00:00,Asking to reflect on things regarding cognitive load
4719,2021-09-27T16:06:22.006000+00:00,Though maybe a sort of survey at the end
4720,2021-09-27T16:05:33.035000+00:00,"Maybe, moderated already paid and scheduled though"
4721,2021-09-27T16:04:09.623000+00:00,"That's better designed than my agency's site atm *weep*

I suppose you could ask them how they're feeling at specific checkpoints but that may not bring about the most concrete answer (how to phrase that is something I'd need to chew on longer because ""well, it's a form..."" might be how they feel). I'm curious if you might get a more accurate result through unmoderated studies where they write their feedback since people tend to really let loose in those."

4729,2021-09-27T15:58:49.536000+00:00,Then mark each time one is noticed
4730,2021-09-27T15:58:32.113000+00:00,Maybe a bingo card with ‚Äòsigns of fatigue‚Äô

4737,2021-09-27T15:53:44.186000+00:00,"Honestly? Maybe this is the wrong answer but it's the first that springs to mind: Signs of fatigue. Think about all the doctor's forms you fill out every year. It's the same stuff, your info hasn't changed; you still gotta go through six pages of *stuff*. Do you see the user filling out things they've done before?"
4738,2021-09-27T15:47:40.600000+00:00,I‚Äôm curious if there‚Äôs some thing to look for when testing these kind of things specifically

4770,2021-09-21T13:20:51.584000+00:00,Ty. I think I have a clearer idea now about my questions now
4771,2021-09-21T13:20:10.702000+00:00,"Like desk research would be a 2D image of a cat, triangulation would be a 3D image of a cat"
4772,2021-09-21T13:19:46.261000+00:00,It simple comes down to; using research from multiple perspectives in order to test how true they are in different contexts.
4773,2021-09-21T13:19:09.003000+00:00,Many presentations about it.
4774,2021-09-21T13:18:58.395000+00:00,"Yeah, it's not a concept you get if you read about it one time"
4775,2021-09-21T13:16:17.127000+00:00,"Hmm I watched this vid 3 times, some part I get it, some I don't."
4776,2021-09-21T13:16:10.066000+00:00,"Q1: 

That depends on the research question, nature of research and scope. If you only have 1/2 weeks for research often desk-research can be effective. If you have a month, you better primary research too, because this will create more depth. If all you use is other peoples research you're just walking behind other people. Also social research is very contextual. So something found in desk-research may not be true in another context. 

If just deskresearch is enough, your research questions are probably weak. To figure out the question ""What do tigers eat?"" You probably get away with just deskresearch. But that's only because your question is so generalized, millions of people have asked it before.

Q2:
That's what the second video goes into. The order depends on the research structure employed. Each research has another structure and some are more effective than others. It often goes hand in hand. For example; I may do research about personalisation of content. I could do some deskresearch first, see which kind of methods are most effective. Than apply to my own product, and again test whether that's effective in my own context. 

Often theory is relevant in context. Examples are behavioural economics, nudging strategies. Often there are not many universal laws of psychology, that's why they never get Nobel Prizes... I think the only psychologist to ever get a Nobel Prize is Daniel Kahneman for Prospect Theory."
4777,2021-09-21T12:56:19.953000+00:00,Ty I'll take a look at the vids
4778,2021-09-21T12:56:07.787000+00:00,"Oh ok let me try to shrink it down.
Q1) Could we skip primary research if we have enough data from desk research?
Q2) (sort of like a conclusion from the long text I wrote) Do we always conduct desk research first, then based upon the trends identified from that, conduct screener survey to skim out the kind of ppl we are looking to interview?"

4785,2021-09-21T09:44:28.985000+00:00,I also suggest you get familiar with the idea of triangulation (which may answer some questions)
4786,2021-09-21T09:38:40.665000+00:00,Because now I see about twenty questions when you seem to think you have two
4787,2021-09-21T09:37:56.441000+00:00,If you had to turn that wall of text in two sentences - the two or three questions you have - what would that be?
4788,2021-09-21T08:13:38.364000+00:00,^^ This was me for the past 30 mins. And I wrote this message here to **verify if my thought process was correct or not**
4789,2021-09-21T08:12:41.458000+00:00,"Ok while typing this question I think I found the answer to it.
We conduct screener surveys first based on trends identified from desk research and determine what kind of participants we need ( in this case ppl who fall asleep) and THEN we interview them to find out more info in that area.
Right? Just wanted to make sure if my thought process is correct or not.
Ah i had another question. If we find enough data from desk research does it make sense to do our own primary research? Because that seems like a waste of time and money.
Ok I found answer to this question too.
""Secondary research is research someone else has done that can help you better understand the space you are working in. Secondary research typically happens prior to primary research.
Primary research is when you conduct first hand research to better understand your users. """
4790,2021-09-21T08:12:20.059000+00:00,"So in that case I'd always have to recruit large amounts of ppl for interviews ( which is not possible often).
So for that reason should we just stick to desk research?"
4791,2021-09-21T08:11:58.574000+00:00,"So now I have 2 questions :
If I'm conducting interviews with low amount of participants ( 10 participants ) then I'd always be unsure if those 10 ppl show the common behavior amongst a group of people and if the data I have gathered from those interviews reflect accurate results."
4792,2021-09-21T08:11:44.867000+00:00,"I was wondering should we do primary research on a topic for which the data is already out there, and which could result in conflict with the results of primary research. Like desk research says something else and interviews suggest something else. 
For example : 
Let's say I was trying to find out if transit commuters fall asleep while traveling or not. And for that I recruit 10 interview participants. 
And all 10 of them were found to be awake during their journey. 
Now from that I'd draw the conclusion that passengers don't fall asleep while traveling. 
But what if there's data out there that shows that some percentage of people do fall asleep. 
And like if I recruited 100 interview participants and out of those, 60 of them were found to fall asleep while commuting."
4793,2021-09-21T08:11:38.527000+00:00,Ok I'm about to type a very long message XD
4794,2021-09-21T00:23:03.053000+00:00,Also things on the bottom are easier to accidentally touch and should be easily recoverable. Moving from one to the other should keep the same state and can easily be returned to.
4795,2021-09-20T19:32:13.836000+00:00,So which is better depends on the context of the navigation
4796,2021-09-20T19:26:47.131000+00:00,"If all browsers on mobile suddenly think ""Lets put all address bars on the bottom"" that may not turn out very well."
4797,2021-09-20T19:25:42.058000+00:00,It may even be so that depending on the functionality people will expect them in different places.
4798,2021-09-20T19:25:05.585000+00:00,"While it's true the bottom one is more efficiently for the fingers, that doesn't mean it's always the most efficient one mentally."
4799,2021-09-20T19:23:10.056000+00:00,"Your second example actually got both of them. One on the bottom, one on the top."
4800,2021-09-20T19:05:10.360000+00:00,"Hello guys! 
whats your opinion about bottom navbars on mobile? 
Is it the best option for usability?

I've been doing some research about it and some studies says the navbar is better at bottom because the thumb is close to it... but the other senior UXs  at my work says that the top menu is better because people are more used to it and its easier to locate the menu there from the Z-pattern reading.... I've always defended the bottom navbar but what they said about the top menu is pretty convincing for me <:FrogThink:800949698880864327>

4814,2021-09-19T16:47:43.096000+00:00,"Yes, people are more prone to do things when you ask them if they do something"
4815,2021-09-19T16:47:19.990000+00:00,What are you trying to validate?
4816,2021-09-19T16:44:43.019000+00:00,But that seems like a tricky and dangerous way to get answers. I think I'd be better off asking non leading questions
4817,2021-09-19T16:43:44.859000+00:00,"Hmm yea but in this case the question wasn't ""too leading"" I guess?
Ok so leading questions could be used to elicit certain answers."
4818,2021-09-19T16:41:24.309000+00:00,Oh so like leading questions could possibly alter the existing behavior or thoughts of a user right?
4819,2021-09-19T16:36:47.303000+00:00,Hm I looked up Triangulation but can't wrap my head around it

4821,2021-09-19T16:04:53.202000+00:00,At 2:16 you can see a leading question used effectively

4823,2021-09-19T16:04:06.443000+00:00,"This has been shared a few times already, but it may help you to understand:"
4824,2021-09-19T15:59:31.036000+00:00,"Otherwise it's just like putting on a blindfold, swinging a stick hoping you hit a pi√±ata."
4825,2021-09-19T15:56:04.334000+00:00,"And also remember a hypothesis is a statement that must be based on something, either earlier observations / interviews, desk-research papers / articles, math/logic"
4826,2021-09-19T15:50:29.257000+00:00,Because then suddenly they will be.
4827,2021-09-19T15:50:22.992000+00:00,"But never ask ""Are you scared of the possible data leaks with this app and that the whole world will know who you are?"""
4828,2021-09-19T15:49:26.459000+00:00,"Bit of a manipulative strategy, journalist use this a lot"
4829,2021-09-19T15:49:02.441000+00:00,Then they will suddenly tell you everything about why they think you are not right
4830,2021-09-19T15:47:42.907000+00:00,"Example of effective use of a leading question is when you know someone is very anti-vaccines and you ask ""Hey, the vaccines are really great aren't they!"""
4831,2021-09-19T15:45:33.613000+00:00,But the problem with leading questions is called priming
4832,2021-09-19T15:45:18.646000+00:00,"Leading questions usually aren't good no, only in some situations they can be useful."
4833,2021-09-19T15:44:02.276000+00:00,"Oh, only saw later you're referring to leading questions..."
4834,2021-09-19T15:39:20.628000+00:00,Validating research is usually done by something called triangulation
4835,2021-09-19T15:35:09.759000+00:00,"Plus usually you don't really use interviews to validate, you use interviews to dig information, then use quantitive methods to validate."
4836,2021-09-19T15:31:29.220000+00:00,"Or for clarification at the end, as in, summarise their answer how you understand it, to see if they say yes or no."
4837,2021-09-19T15:30:50.478000+00:00,Closed questions you can use when you want to get to the next point (and if they talk too much)
4838,2021-09-19T15:30:29.772000+00:00,"It kind of depends what exactly you hope to have answered too. Both closed questions / open ended questions have their own value. You usually want to keep asking open questions, where they can't answer yes or no."
4839,2021-09-19T15:28:58.659000+00:00,"Interviewing is more about talking about their problems, never your solution"
4840,2021-09-19T11:00:23.468000+00:00,"Oh I think I was confused by ""Close ended questions"" and ""leading questions"". I think its okay to ask close ended questions but not leading ques"
4841,2021-09-19T10:57:35.572000+00:00,Hm seems like im having a Q/A session with myself here lol
4842,2021-09-19T10:57:04.802000+00:00,"Ok I just read that in most cases, yes/no questions should be followed by ‚ÄúWhy?‚Äù or ‚ÄúIn what ways?‚Äù"
4843,2021-09-19T10:53:10.232000+00:00,"IMO we should be able to ask close ended questions too, but I might be wrong"
4844,2021-09-19T10:51:59.965000+00:00,"Ok now I have another question. Do we always have to ask open ended question? Like asking questions which won't result in ""yes"" or ""no"" answers. 
Heck then how do we validate hypothesis questions?"
4845,2021-09-19T08:54:02.410000+00:00,"Hello. While framing questions for an interview should we try to avoid asking the users to give us a solution that they think would lessen/eliminate their problem? 
Or us proposing a solution to them and see their opinions on it?
Kind of like verifying our hypothesis?
But again, I've learned that interview questions shouldn't be leading, so ye that contradicts the above statement i guess.

Wait then how do we conduct hypothesis testing then?
Don't we present our assumptions about a user to the user and ask them if that's the correct representation of them?"
4846,2021-09-18T20:08:20.282000+00:00,So far at least
4847,2021-09-18T20:08:15.936000+00:00,"Did a bit of R today, seemed straightforward enough"
4848,2021-09-18T19:29:48.036000+00:00,Just do R or Python like Alexa and Prototype recommended

4850,2021-09-18T18:45:28.684000+00:00,csv is pretty standard format
4851,2021-09-18T18:44:43.411000+00:00,"could even use MATLAB for it as well, though it is mainly focused on traditional engineering"
4852,2021-09-18T16:41:17.194000+00:00,"So I don't have to use their stats, but their data instead"
4853,2021-09-18T16:40:09.662000+00:00,So the sources of papers lead to databases like that
4854,2021-09-18T16:39:09.376000+00:00,For example
4855,2021-09-18T16:39:05.659000+00:00,https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/web/education-and-training/data/database
4856,2021-09-18T16:38:40.063000+00:00,Or TSV
4857,2021-09-18T16:38:36.364000+00:00,It's just that a lot of sources for open data make it downloadable in CSV
4858,2021-09-18T16:38:11.091000+00:00,"Ahhh, yeah no that's not what's currently happening haha"
4859,2021-09-18T16:33:40.816000+00:00,he means like a lot of businesses making a huge excel table and calling it a data base haha
4860,2021-09-18T14:11:13.980000+00:00,"Yeah, I'm trying out R now"
4861,2021-09-18T14:10:28.883000+00:00,CSV as a dataset is still fine. That's just how the data is organized--separated by commas.
4862,2021-09-18T13:56:51.031000+00:00,"Excel lacks speed, versatility, and functionality when it comes to any data *remotely* large (+10-20k rows).

4868,2021-09-17T20:42:58.953000+00:00,Then I think R would be best. That‚Äôs the only thing I need currently
4869,2021-09-17T19:31:32.282000+00:00,I feel like it all depends on what you're trying to accomplish.
4870,2021-09-17T19:30:07.061000+00:00,there will always be some people who abandon for reasons outside your immediate control
4871,2021-09-17T19:29:51.896000+00:00,"as in, no matter how good your funnel is"
4872,2021-09-17T19:29:28.193000+00:00,I've read that between like 5-10% abandon rates are typical
4873,2021-09-17T19:28:41.242000+00:00,"hey everyone, is there an industry standard high drop-off rate? Trying to help a non-profit determine if their drop-off rates are high. I can't seem to find any firm numbers via Google search"
4874,2021-09-17T19:28:06.525000+00:00,I'd probably also spend some time with d3.js
4875,2021-09-17T19:26:09.087000+00:00,R is almost only for statistical analysis
4876,2021-09-17T19:26:00.914000+00:00,python is used for lots of things
4877,2021-09-17T19:24:17.732000+00:00,For JSON it would just be filter methods
4878,2021-09-17T19:23:54.627000+00:00,"But I‚Äôm pretty familiar with arrays, loops, logic conditions, fetch thingies"
4879,2021-09-17T19:16:59.729000+00:00,Only JSON type in JavaScript
4880,2021-09-17T19:16:42.051000+00:00,But never really python and R
4881,2021-09-17T19:16:29.802000+00:00,I know some C and JavaScript
4882,2021-09-17T19:16:18.285000+00:00,Any pro and con for python and r?
4883,2021-09-17T16:50:55.947000+00:00,"honestly, if you're using big data you need to jump onto learning excel and then python or r immediately if you haven't done so"
4884,2021-09-17T16:49:48.279000+00:00,i prefer python for excel but it is really a preference thing. get good enough in r or python there's nothing you technically can't do. it just isnt as straightforward
4885,2021-09-17T16:44:38.223000+00:00,SPSS is also expensive though
4886,2021-09-17T16:41:48.794000+00:00,or compute new variable if you need some logic or math to make the new variable
4887,2021-09-17T16:41:11.875000+00:00,"Qualtrics has some tools for data. I have only used SPSS for data and you would be needing to select what the data type is for each column. It may require you to do some coding of the variables. I used transform->recode into different variable so you keep the raw data and get shiny new variables to use.
I have heard that R is great for data cleaning, but I have not used it myself. I would ask on mixed methods slack as they would know more about R and python."
4888,2021-09-17T14:50:35.270000+00:00,Some tools that help you collect the data have some built in reporting tools as well so you can check there first. That's usually what I do
4889,2021-09-17T13:04:38.146000+00:00,With several tenthousands of rows
4890,2021-09-17T13:03:44.690000+00:00,
4891,2021-09-17T13:03:40.030000+00:00,Then it just kind of looks like this
4892,2021-09-17T13:02:39.768000+00:00,"This is usually when papers do share their raw data, but only done the analysis in their own way in the stats"
4893,2021-09-17T13:01:17.180000+00:00,\
4894,2021-09-17T13:00:12.296000+00:00,But I thought R or Python might be a bit better
4895,2021-09-17T13:00:03.691000+00:00,I know many use SPSS
4896,2021-09-17T12:59:58.783000+00:00,"Heyo question;

Often I'm left with just a ton of quantitative raw data in some CSV format, which is kind of difficult / time consuming to easily make sense of. What are you fav tools to analyse this kind of data?"
4897,2021-09-17T07:29:13.885000+00:00,Free software such as miro can be ideal for cardsorting
4898,2021-09-16T20:14:30.804000+00:00,she answered my question below ‚¨áÔ∏è
4899,2021-09-16T20:12:31.076000+00:00,"Thanks everyone! Just recently found out that this was part of my responsibilities. I was under the impression I'd be more heuristic and visual design.

Anyway, I just found out that I only probably only have usertesting available as a tool. Is there any way for me to be able to conduct the tree testing and/or card sort manually? I really hope I don't have to do more since I only have a week to do the research, I have about 10-15 participants, and then I have to design the second week after the first week."
4900,2021-09-16T15:28:11.097000+00:00,"It is tough for me to respond to each comment as I wasn't part of the conversation above but I am getting the impression that you are jumping into the study. 

I really encourage you to stop and ask yourself what is the goal of each study? What questions need to be asked? and then think about what methodology you need to use."
4901,2021-09-16T15:22:53.614000+00:00,"Hey Honey, I prefer using Qualtrics for A/B testing which tracks the data for you. However, I would clarify with the product team whether they're referring to A/B tests as in live A/B testing through analytics. 

Also, I think some of the things you're running into is what researchers typically designate as prep time for the team. I usually get buy-in for every study before even launching them so that when the results come out, our team is more receptive to the changes. 

Running a study is only half of the researcher's responsibility. A successful researcher is going to spend considerable amounts of effort influencing and prepping their teammates through 1:1's and constant updates for teammates. Research is more successful when other people say they need it."
4902,2021-09-16T13:00:35.330000+00:00,What do you mean?
4903,2021-09-16T12:47:45.109000+00:00,"Oh. I meant like, how do I track the data for it?"
4904,2021-09-15T22:48:32.046000+00:00,"think about it, what is an A/B test"
4905,2021-09-15T22:48:21.722000+00:00,it doesnt have to be moderated but rather
4906,2021-09-15T22:30:12.109000+00:00,ahh. so like a moderated a/b test? I'm preparing myself for when we have a clash of ideas. a split test would really be helpful!
4907,2021-09-15T20:32:57.499000+00:00,And from that data see what insights you get
4908,2021-09-15T20:32:49.392000+00:00,Another session with prototype B get results
4909,2021-09-15T20:32:39.528000+00:00,One session with prototype A get results
4910,2021-09-15T20:32:29.348000+00:00,Just run two sessions
4911,2021-09-15T20:32:25.876000+00:00,Any tool should be able to do that
4912,2021-09-15T20:32:21.435000+00:00,A/B tests mean you test two designs that are similar but you changed something and you‚Äôre trying to determine if that one change was better and prove it quantitatively
4913,2021-09-15T20:17:57.463000+00:00,"Sorry guys! I have another question. What would be a good tool for A/B split tests? I might have to do that quite a bit in the near future. I'm trying to cover all my bases. 

UserZoom doesn't seem to do it. Not sure!"
4914,2021-09-15T17:26:11.666000+00:00,Yes! Absolutely! Thank you so much!
4915,2021-09-15T17:11:59.058000+00:00,"take the two options and weigh it out, it might not be the best suggestion üôÇ"
4916,2021-09-15T17:11:38.341000+00:00,okay awesome! that sounds like a much more solid plan!
4917,2021-09-15T17:11:25.799000+00:00,its very very similar to card sort
4918,2021-09-15T17:11:19.767000+00:00,this one:https://www.optimalworkshop.com/learn/101s/tree-testing/
4919,2021-09-15T17:11:00.145000+00:00,and see what works what doesnt
4920,2021-09-15T17:10:51.681000+00:00,"but i think since you want to test nav, it might be easier to jump straight into a tree test"
4921,2021-09-15T17:10:39.217000+00:00,vs all they have is the cards
4922,2021-09-15T17:10:33.826000+00:00,"and if they cant find one that fits, create their own category"
4923,2021-09-15T17:10:24.844000+00:00,"what you could do is rename it yourself, then ask them to sort"
4924,2021-09-15T17:09:59.521000+00:00,that's a great idea actually! wouldn't a closed card sort not allow them to be able to rename items as they see fit though? all of the naming is done by the engineering team and we all know they usually speak a different language than the other teams.
4925,2021-09-15T17:09:56.405000+00:00,just something to keep in mind
4926,2021-09-15T17:08:41.991000+00:00,I would recommend leaving/saving Engineering last since that group is the one who developed it so they already would have some biases within
4927,2021-09-15T17:08:14.569000+00:00,then just do a tree test
4928,2021-09-15T17:08:11.304000+00:00,"as a Designer, look at what was done and rearrange it to what you think is optimal"
4929,2021-09-15T17:07:59.987000+00:00,what you could do if youre strapped for time is closed card sort or even
4930,2021-09-15T17:07:44.747000+00:00,longer only that you might find theres some commonalities but in the end some stuff its split
4931,2021-09-15T17:07:03.351000+00:00,Oh damn. Even with a tool to analyze it?
4932,2021-09-15T17:06:40.590000+00:00,But it would also take longer mind you
4933,2021-09-15T17:06:32.098000+00:00,Ah so a open card sort that would work well
4934,2021-09-15T16:51:17.815000+00:00,"Didn't even think about who's going to be reluctant just yet but this is a good point to always think about. I have to find out whose baby this platform is

but also, from the looks of it, they did start redesigning it but then quickly figured they'd need a designer to do it. They didn't finish their initial redesigns but they did break the sub menus down into categories and that is what I'm trying to test. Testing if the sub menus are actually arranged the way other stakeholders would interact and if they're named accordingly. I think a hybrid sort would be a great approach. I'll have everything laid out in one thing without telling them which ones are categories, which ones aren't. They'll have the option to add/edit the names and categories according to how they understand it."
4935,2021-09-15T01:08:52.623000+00:00,I would probably recommend starting with them first and converting them to supportive
4936,2021-09-15T01:08:39.235000+00:00,but also the most critical
4937,2021-09-15T01:08:35.047000+00:00,who in that list would be the most reluctant to change or against it
4938,2021-09-15T01:08:20.278000+00:00,thats a great point so without giving you the answer
4939,2021-09-15T00:51:13.147000+00:00,"Most of the assumptions are done by the engineering team since (like most products I work on) they only worked on this product from the ground up and now that it‚Äôs getting cluttered, they want me to de clutter  it."
4940,2021-09-15T00:50:02.514000+00:00,what are the assumptions you want to test
4941,2021-09-15T00:49:55.593000+00:00,think about what is your selection criteria
4942,2021-09-15T00:49:44.254000+00:00,those would be great participants
4943,2021-09-15T00:49:13.302000+00:00,"Engineers
Project managers
Business stakeholders 
Data analysts
Support/operations"
4944,2021-09-14T21:28:19.760000+00:00,I guess since yours is associative there might still be some influences in words that are used in specific industries
4945,2021-09-14T21:27:12.604000+00:00,Audience becomes much more important when doing descriptive test
4946,2021-09-14T21:24:46.266000+00:00,"Unless there are huge difference in tech ability, like grandma VS UX Designer"
4947,2021-09-14T21:24:15.844000+00:00,"Audience isn't as important in a behavioural test, since (usually) navigation behaviour is very consistent among different people, that's why you only need 5 for a user test."
4948,2021-09-14T21:23:28.173000+00:00,Who on the internal is using it?
4949,2021-09-14T21:22:33.186000+00:00,I think this would be a great first step! My main problem though is that it‚Äôs an internal company tool so not sure who my audience for testing would be or am I overthinking this?
4950,2021-09-14T21:22:22.657000+00:00,"I've only used Usability hub and Maze, I think <@!733042329140723792> used UserZoom"
4951,2021-09-14T21:21:17.765000+00:00,"Ohhh! Thanks guys!! I really appreciate it. Have you both used user zoom? Seems promising and if not, what would be great tools to use? I‚Äôve already tried maze and it‚Äôs great. Wondering if there are more I missed! <@!209640428151111680> <@!589247034410926088>"
4952,2021-09-14T21:06:46.168000+00:00,See how labels improve navigation without actually needing to entirely design the prototype
4953,2021-09-14T21:06:04.292000+00:00,Which doesn't require any complex/expensive tools
4954,2021-09-14T21:05:48.568000+00:00,https://www.nngroup.com/articles/tree-testing/
4955,2021-09-14T21:05:06.488000+00:00,"You can also do ""Tree Testing"" and see how the different variants hold up in the trees"
4956,2021-09-14T21:04:07.597000+00:00,I think click test can be run in UserZoom and UsabilityHub
4957,2021-09-14T21:01:20.216000+00:00,Then again you can do a multivariant test a / b / c and see the success rate of the clicktest for each variant of the term used
4958,2021-09-14T21:00:12.659000+00:00,"You basically say ""Where would you click to find X"""
4959,2021-09-14T20:59:27.374000+00:00,Or instead of that you could do a click test
4960,2021-09-14T20:55:41.417000+00:00,This way you could also very easily display this in a graph
4961,2021-09-14T20:50:41.990000+00:00,"Though, instead you already show the 'finished cards' and just let them name it / choose the labels for the group of cards"
4962,2021-09-14T20:49:50.197000+00:00,Cardsorting is also great for naming
4963,2021-09-14T20:48:53.665000+00:00,That's the quant way at least
4964,2021-09-14T20:48:43.253000+00:00,You can then compare the three variants with each other to see if it influences what they expect to see behind it (and what they don't)
4965,2021-09-14T20:48:15.683000+00:00,"So for example; you have three variants of the same screen. Each user gets to see another one with the different naming. You then asked in the survey/quant test; which of these items do you expect to find behind this label? Then they can choose between items, selecting those that apply."
4966,2021-09-14T20:44:51.526000+00:00,And see how the differences of expectations map up
4967,2021-09-14T20:44:41.159000+00:00,Then sort of run a multivariant test
4968,2021-09-14T20:43:15.467000+00:00,"Here you can literally show a screen and ask ""What do you expect to find behind this nav item?"""
4969,2021-09-14T20:42:27.377000+00:00,You can also test that through things like maze and usabilityhub
4970,2021-09-14T20:39:52.169000+00:00,test it. if ppl can find it or navigate its not named badly
4971,2021-09-14T20:03:53.311000+00:00,Hi everyone! Question: What's a good research methodology for naming conventions? I'm trying to verify/rename navigation names. I know card sorting is great for the IA but  is there anything I'm missing as far as naming?
4972,2021-09-14T18:09:10.068000+00:00,Okay will do. Ty
4973,2021-09-14T18:07:37.524000+00:00,That‚Äôs usually in the realm of Product Stategy/ Product Management
4974,2021-09-14T18:07:22.090000+00:00,Check out the book Lean Startup
4975,2021-09-14T17:56:55.317000+00:00,yep
4976,2021-09-14T17:47:13.393000+00:00,You could always check if there's other data available!
4977,2021-09-14T17:34:38.527000+00:00,More like getting a general idea of what the scene is like around that topic
4978,2021-09-14T17:33:47.958000+00:00,I see. But could be helpful if we want to quickly semi-validate a project idea
4979,2021-09-14T17:28:10.151000+00:00,"Yup, indeed. It's more used in market research than UX research though"
4980,2021-09-14T17:01:36.065000+00:00,Oh so need to pay to use their data?
4981,2021-09-14T15:02:49.291000+00:00,Not free though
4982,2021-09-14T15:02:44.035000+00:00,Just lots of statistics that can be useful in deskresearch
4983,2021-09-14T15:01:05.995000+00:00,"Just a survey database basically, surveys that have been conducted before about a subject."
4984,2021-09-14T14:59:34.667000+00:00,What is this btw?
4985,2021-09-14T14:46:17.720000+00:00,Also found: https://www.statista.com/
4986,2021-09-14T14:22:51.440000+00:00,If I'm correct you can get some data from Google insights based on search terms...
4987,2021-09-14T14:11:06.524000+00:00,"If so, I'd love some sources on certain techniques used to conduct such research"
4988,2021-09-14T14:08:32.781000+00:00,More towards market research than UX I suppose...
4989,2021-09-14T14:08:09.459000+00:00,Has anyone here ever conducted quantitative target audience research?
4990,2021-09-14T12:46:43.370000+00:00,ohh this is nice thanks

4999,2021-09-14T12:41:35.953000+00:00,Also look for Reddit sampleSize
5000,2021-09-14T12:41:04.696000+00:00,So basically the function of the survey is just so you can scope who you want to talk to and who not
5001,2021-09-14T12:40:00.059000+00:00,"Yes, basically you set up some small questions that help you find the right people"
5002,2021-09-14T12:19:12.209000+00:00,"got it 
thanks for the help"
5003,2021-09-14T12:18:37.955000+00:00,Just a small survey with 10 questions
5004,2021-09-14T12:18:29.744000+00:00,Aks if you can DM them on discord and they can leave their discord ID

5006,2021-09-14T12:17:54.440000+00:00,We got <#708809627260944436> for that
5007,2021-09-14T12:17:06.565000+00:00,is it ok if i ask in this channel?
5008,2021-09-14T12:15:56.385000+00:00,where can i ask for help with research in this server?

5012,2021-09-14T12:14:56.940000+00:00,i am a student
5013,2021-09-14T12:14:45.442000+00:00,finding people with depression and asking them will be hard tho
5014,2021-09-14T12:14:15.349000+00:00,Also frame you're a student (if you are)
5015,2021-09-14T12:14:00.604000+00:00,"ohh , got it thanks"
5016,2021-09-14T12:11:43.380000+00:00,How you frame it is very important though
5017,2021-09-14T12:09:33.298000+00:00,This got me 6 people to test
5018,2021-09-14T12:09:15.196000+00:00,Can be as simple as writing a post like this: https://www.linkedin.com/posts/dario-sanchez-martinez_looking-for-feedback-for-graduating-at-activity-6768495723630731264-_FQx

5022,2021-09-14T06:53:57.247000+00:00,"It‚Äôs hard to be specific about what deliverable will be useful if you‚Äôre not specific about the context haha. 

Surely feel free to PM"
5023,2021-09-14T06:52:52.369000+00:00,Do you mind if I message you privatly because I don't want to be really specific about the product here and all of that?
5024,2021-09-14T06:49:12.637000+00:00,When you say ‚Äúflow‚Äù what are you referring to?
5025,2021-09-14T06:43:16.674000+00:00,Not an existing product as in; the product is not live?
5026,2021-09-14T06:38:27.678000+00:00,"It's kinda complex to explain without the whole context but I talked to people and catched their goals, needs, painpoints with existing flow they are going through, but their flow is not within existing product, that's what I meant, I want to improve their existing flow and put it into more effective way for doing what they do now."
5027,2021-09-14T06:30:33.380000+00:00,"But you say it‚Äôs not an existing product, what do you mean by that then?"
5028,2021-09-14T06:28:18.590000+00:00,"Yes, because I saw that the problem is around the existing flow the users are going through. That's why I want to catch their thinking, needs, goals while  creating a better way for them."
5029,2021-09-14T06:26:25.406000+00:00,"Well, you‚Äôre saying ‚ÄúI want it to be around mu solution‚Äù or am I understanding incorrectly?"
5030,2021-09-14T06:24:58.385000+00:00,"I'm sorry but I don't exactly know what do you mean by ""you're talking about the solution before mapping the problem"".  What would you do in my case?"
5031,2021-09-14T06:20:04.431000+00:00,Basically without the product it‚Äôs the ‚Äúcurrent situation‚Äù and the product would be ‚Äúdesired situation‚Äù (your product acting in the current situation)
5032,2021-09-14T06:18:45.558000+00:00,Scenarios and journeys can both be applied even without a product
5033,2021-09-14T06:16:51.973000+00:00,"Since it‚Äôs a flow it‚Äôs a time based process. So there you do a user journey instead. 

That way you can map the flow in sections and analyse where in the flow you could optimize / make a change.

The red flag here is that you‚Äôre you‚Äôre already talking about the solution before mapping the problem. Why is that?"
5034,2021-09-14T06:11:31.834000+00:00,"thanks for answer Dario as always. With all the information I want to inform my future user flow, how can I make it smoother for the user so all 3 groups of people can do their tasks with necessary steps to fill their needs quickly etc. I don't know if that makes sense so that's why I thought about scenarios. When I was reading about all of the ux mapping only empathy mapping is the method which can be applied in my context since it's not an existing product and I want it bo be around my solution, so maybe that's the go? I don't know if all of this makes any sense to you, but I'm new to doing good UX, if you don't have time to answer my weird questions just don't bother."

5045,2021-09-13T15:46:00.555000+00:00,The salt on League is too much
5046,2021-09-13T15:45:34.685000+00:00,FINE. we can play dodgeball
5047,2021-09-13T15:45:03.475000+00:00,Why would I go to league willingly? I don't want to submit myself to that
5048,2021-09-13T15:42:21.644000+00:00,Afaik the gazepoint got its own software turning the raw data into heatmaps right?

5058,2021-09-13T13:53:11.720000+00:00,"So in order to find the best method, first concretely define what your goal is behind displaying it."
5059,2021-09-13T13:52:40.049000+00:00,"A good thing to keep in mind is that all things, personas, journeys, scenarios are merely tools for displaying data. You don't need a persona to be user centered. The goal is understanding the person, not creating the persona, the persona is just the proof that yuou did"
5060,2021-09-13T13:46:18.054000+00:00,Journey maps when you want to find opportunities in a time based context (like a user flow) / processes or systems that are important
5061,2021-09-13T13:44:53.257000+00:00,"Scenarios are only useful if you:
- Want to display situations where the product is used (For example, ordering food)
- Display user activities that involve the product (For example, ordering food while driving a car)
- When the upper two are complex enough not be efficiently explained by words (for example, ordering food everyone understands, nobody needs to see a scenario to understand how people order food. Ordering food while driving a car though might need a scenario)"
5062,2021-09-13T13:42:50.986000+00:00,So what are you hoping to learn and what do you wish to do with that information?
5063,2021-09-13T13:41:55.225000+00:00,"That entirely depends what you want to gain by it...

The method of UX deliverable depends on what answers you or your stakeholders currently need to have answered . The deliverable is not the goal, it's just to display the research in a presentable way for other people (or yourself) to understand it when making certain decisions."
5064,2021-09-13T11:44:39.990000+00:00,"Hello buddies <:peepoLove:805555753154904105> I've conducted some user interviews and surveys, with all the data I'm going to create 3 personas. The project is conceptual so here comes my question: Which method to do after I create personas, I mean the best method to create a scenario for each one persona: UX mapping or storyboards, or maybe something else? Have a nice day : )"
5065,2021-09-13T05:36:32.407000+00:00,"Thanks, should try and test it out soon! There‚Äôs a calibration guide as well"
5066,2021-09-12T16:37:53.094000+00:00,"You never want to have eye tracking as your main data pillar, it should always be used as a support rather than your main data collection. But you can take a qualitative approach and run just 6 people that wouldn‚Äôt be an issue"
5067,2021-09-12T08:39:33.529000+00:00,"Nice! Is it useable with few testers, lets say 6 people testing it, can I accurately get data?"
5068,2021-09-12T01:17:42.067000+00:00,"The eyetracking from gazepoint is really nice since unlike the glasses, it doesn't have the limitations of glasses and it's a lot easier to calibrate <@!209640428151111680>"

5077,2021-09-10T14:05:35.127000+00:00,A good scope and test script can be very important too!
5078,2021-09-10T13:04:27.773000+00:00,Thank you for the detailed response! I think my problem may have been I was skipping a few steps üòÖ
5079,2021-09-09T14:53:54.561000+00:00,"have you built your case on changing the scheduling portion of the website? if no, usability test and record them and show stakeholders how many appointments = $$$ they're missing on to get buy in for the project so it can go smoothly 
if you have analytics, you can take the extra step to tie it with actual numbers and calculate the estimated money they're missing out on
userflow testing to build out the flow that makes the most sense for users and mental model interviews which are low fidelity. at this point you should also start including developers into the conversation as they will make comments on technical constraints like apis and you need to work with them and convince them so that they will not push back once it hits the tickets <:th_haha:806043841706590231> i recommend not skipping this step ever
concept testing to test a more mid fidelity of the 2~ flows you've finalized on. at this point you should have a good idea of the direction you want to go with 
usability testing etc

at least that's how i would go for something that can impact the bottom line significantly"
5080,2021-09-09T14:23:04.567000+00:00,"Thank you both for the links! 

For more context I work for a healthcare company. On our website patients are able to schedule appointments online for some specialties but for others they have to call the office or be referred. We also have a few procedures on the website that patients can call to schedule for but patients believe they can schedule these online, they can not. Further complicating things is we have urgent/get care today type appointments as well which are separate from regular appointment types. 

Basically we have dozens of appointment types with different scheduling conditions and some very confused patients who can't find anything. I'm trying to overhaul the schedule an appointment page to bring all of this info together in a way that's helpful"
5081,2021-09-09T14:00:57.024000+00:00,"Usually when I start feeling stuck, I take a moment to assess what I've learned so far and what my goals were and what I choose do next is directly correlated to what I still need to know / find out, like were the initial assumptions validated by the users? Ideally you‚Äôre empathizing with the users and allowing their feedback to guide your process. 

Also, I agree w <@!209640428151111680>, if you could give a bit of context we could give you suggestions about next steps that might be more helpful or you can try to make that decision on your own with resources like https://www.userinterviews.com/blog/how-do-i-choose-the-right-ux-research-method"
5082,2021-09-09T13:57:29.543000+00:00,Lots of books too like; https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1868.Observing_the_User_Experience

Does anyone have any advice for picking the ""right"" research method or getting to the bottom of a problem your users are having?

5091,2021-09-08T15:18:58.947000+00:00,To really find out you got to test that in your own context
5092,2021-09-08T14:49:25.290000+00:00,Kind of depends on the context used for the CTA

5119,2021-09-02T15:52:57.971000+00:00,Especially since most UX designers know the general design patterns. While your mom will (maybe) not understand that a hamburger menu is even a thing
5120,2021-09-02T15:43:38.794000+00:00,They can! But it‚Äôs not about the relevance but testing in people like you will result into echo chambers
5121,2021-09-02T12:17:53.813000+00:00,"Just checked and even in the pureRef menu there's no option to support or donate, which I think is a missed opportunity. It's a great program and I might've considered paying at some point if shown the option."
5122,2021-09-02T12:04:31.200000+00:00,"I think it's a bit presumptuous to assume someone will want to donate 10 bucks before they've used the program, but I do prefer this to them asking me after I've downloaded and used it (like winrar)."

5136,2021-09-02T00:26:46.873000+00:00,"Oh yeah because UX people can have zero other relevant interests to a project, such as pet ownership, mental health issues, hobbies, whatever."
5137,2021-09-01T21:17:14.960000+00:00,"But that will just depend on the opinion of the person looking at it in the end, they may not share mine"
5138,2021-09-01T21:15:57.640000+00:00,"If that's the assigned target demographic that's different of course, but if you have chosen it yourself as a focus; the further a person is from your personal context the more challenging the research recruiting will appear to be."
5139,2021-09-01T21:12:41.685000+00:00,That's subjective though
5140,2021-09-01T21:12:34.636000+00:00,"Kind of depends, using fellow UXers to participate in research can sometimes be viewed as a bit 'lazy', because it shows you're not looking much further than the people around you to have as a target demographic"
5141,2021-09-01T20:50:31.189000+00:00,"yeah i figured people in that group would be more likely to fall within my target audience so thats why i did it, thanks!"
5142,2021-09-01T20:49:41.073000+00:00,i posted a survey in a UX group on another platform and was told that it was really problematic but i mean there are channels here specifically for posting surveys and it is a design community. so idk i was confused
5143,2021-09-01T20:49:09.394000+00:00,"I mean if they fall within the demographic that you need, then I don‚Äôt see a problem"
5144,2021-09-01T20:48:31.294000+00:00,"Hi- i have a question, is it bad practice/frowned upon to ask fellow UXers to participate in user research and complete your surveys for personal/portfolio projects?"
5145,2021-09-01T13:46:25.576000+00:00,Awesome.   so cool.
5146,2021-09-01T05:44:30.781000+00:00,"Heyo Den, could you give some context? What was the goal of the brainstorm and how did that lead to the research and what is the goal of that research/what are you hoping to gain? Since the product already exists, why is it foundational?"
5147,2021-08-31T19:33:25.480000+00:00,"Hi, small UX question, during the foundational research phase to get user data, do I select users according to the answers given during the brainstorming or at contrary do I need a very varied panel even if it means not being in the target of my product ?"
5148,2021-08-30T22:10:11.477000+00:00,<@!209640428151111680> Thank you!
5149,2021-08-30T21:34:10.626000+00:00,But when macdonald does it it‚Äôs a problem because it‚Äôs unexpected
5150,2021-08-30T21:33:49.100000+00:00,"Everyone understands their tomtom tracks their GPS, they don‚Äôt care"
5151,2021-08-30T21:33:12.898000+00:00,So it‚Äôs more about not surprising the user
5152,2021-08-30T21:32:13.634000+00:00,So I suppose in general people don‚Äôt mind tracking/invading of their privacy aslong they are aware
5153,2021-08-30T21:31:38.536000+00:00,People don‚Äôt mind google maps gps tracking because location is very important in the app and brings value to finding the route etc
5154,2021-08-30T21:30:23.489000+00:00,Also there needs to be strong incentive to the user
5155,2021-08-30T21:30:06.711000+00:00,"This is why the new IoS update gives the option

‚ÄúAllow while using the app‚Äù
‚ÄúAlways allow‚Äù
‚ÄúDon‚Äôt allow‚Äù"
5156,2021-08-30T21:28:51.130000+00:00,"Generally people are not against tracking, but against background gps tracking"
5157,2021-08-30T20:18:42+00:00,"What are your thoughts/ feelings about apps tracking your GPS location? I feel like I've given up caring about my location and data being taken by various tech companies because its never ending.
On the other side of things, I know many people who are really annoyed and do as much as they can to deter this. WDYT?"
5158,2021-08-30T17:36:17.280000+00:00,"Hi I have question about a website I'm working for my client. They are brewery brand and sells beer along with their partner's Pizza like food court offline.

5173,2021-08-28T09:01:59.911000+00:00,Excellent points! Which book is this?
5174,2021-08-28T07:47:26.412000+00:00,"Interesting summarisation of doing research from a book I'm reading:

‚Ä¢ Focus on the problem not the solution. 
‚Ä¢ Create an explicit research question (actually write it down with a question mark at the end). 
‚Ä¢ Don‚Äôt start doing any research until you have this question. 
‚Ä¢ Don‚Äôt assume the question has never been asked before. 
‚Ä¢ Find out what your colleagues and your company already knows. 
‚Ä¢ Do an archival search‚Äîstart by reading any prior research reports. 
‚Ä¢ Interview team members and stakeholders. 
‚Ä¢ Use a checklist to collect background information in a systematic manner. 
‚Ä¢ Leave nothing to guesswork.

‚Ä¢ Watch people actually doing their work‚Äîdon‚Äôt just get a demonstration. 
‚Ä¢ Remember that your participants are the experts, you are the ‚Äúnovice.‚Äù 
‚Ä¢ Focus on the most typical tasks, busiest days, typical days, and critical incidents. 
‚Ä¢ Find out what activities precede and follow the task you are observing. 
‚Ä¢ Look for inconveniences, delays, and frustrations. 
‚Ä¢ Shadow people; follow them wherever they go. 
‚Ä¢ Point to things and find out what they are for. 
‚Ä¢ Get copies or photos of artifacts, samples, forms, and documents. 
‚Ä¢ Make diagrams of the workspace. 
‚Ä¢ List the tools people are using. 
‚Ä¢ note people dynamics and interactions. 
‚Ä¢ Be alert to things happening simultaneously. 
‚Ä¢ Record anything unusual about the scene you are looking at. 
‚Ä¢ Ask yourself if anything is missing. 
‚Ä¢ observe behavior at a low level of detail‚Äîwatch what people touch and what they look at.
 ‚Ä¢ Pay attention to the sequences and timing of events and actions. 
‚Ä¢ Don‚Äôt get in the way. 
‚Ä¢ Pay attention to trifles"
5175,2021-08-27T11:59:14.175000+00:00,"Nice, listening to it now"
5176,2021-08-27T08:45:31.709000+00:00,"I started learning it from Nielsen Norman Group, there is a lot of it, how to choose the best research method at a specific stage, how to do for example user interviews, card sorting, etc. https://www.nngroup.com/topic/research-methods/"
5177,2021-08-27T08:25:08.350000+00:00,Also Awkward Silence podcast has lots of interesting episodes
5178,2021-08-27T08:23:55.548000+00:00,"I'll consider skillshare, i somehow forgot about it"
5179,2021-08-27T08:22:32.256000+00:00,And how to use them in order to control conversations (to some extent)
5180,2021-08-27T08:22:29.272000+00:00,"I started on skillshare watching videos about UX and Research and then did a course on general assembly. But there's so many resources out there on different pathways and how to get into the industry,"
5181,2021-08-27T08:22:03.364000+00:00,"Specifically learning about question types, such as open questions, leading questions, closed questions, etc"
5182,2021-08-27T08:21:17.616000+00:00,I started with user interviews!
5183,2021-08-27T08:16:54.810000+00:00,"Hi 

Where do I start learning UX research? how did you start üòä"
5184,2021-08-27T07:35:54.949000+00:00,Thanks a lot for answer.
5185,2021-08-27T07:31:34.814000+00:00,I think it's a great way to test key questions though
5186,2021-08-27T07:31:02.596000+00:00,But an interview is not an informal conversation
5187,2021-08-27T07:27:33.299000+00:00,"But yes, it can still work, if it's all you got."
5188,2021-08-27T07:27:16.513000+00:00,"What happens is that you give a person a lot of time to think about the answers, instead of being in the moment, and it can then be more difficult to dig. Also lack of body language / verbal tone will cause a lot of noise for both parties"
5189,2021-08-27T07:23:25.308000+00:00,"It's better than nothing, but non direct interviewing can sometimes lead to faulty insights / misunderstanding the context"
5190,2021-08-27T07:22:04.434000+00:00,I've attempted it before
5191,2021-08-26T18:02:06.356000+00:00,"Hello everyone, I have bothering question about doing user interviews, I am currently doing a conceptual project and I don't have any payment to give people. The end-user is quite rare, so I was thinking about conducting user interviews in form of informal chatting with people, is it appropriate? <a:BouncingBunny:772353449459318794>"
5192,2021-08-26T14:21:05.880000+00:00,makes sense!
5193,2021-08-26T13:59:17.835000+00:00,That anyone with or without your research could use to design mailbox organisation tools
5194,2021-08-26T13:59:06.103000+00:00,"So for now, aim for creating rules of thumb"
5195,2021-08-26T13:57:57.947000+00:00,If that makes sense
5196,2021-08-26T13:57:51.226000+00:00,"For example if your insight is: ""People desire more control of their inbox because X & Y"" And ""The current alternatives do not work because X & Y"", you can then translate it to a few rules of thumb, then if you have a concept test you don't test the product as the product, but as a translation of the rule of thumb"
5197,2021-08-26T13:49:18.525000+00:00,"Then basically if you know the data and can set certain principles, you can directly use them for brainstorming solutions - and use them as prototype rules"
5198,2021-08-26T13:48:33.765000+00:00,"I guess that depends on how much time you're willing to spent! You can always include an extra iteration of more in depth interviews, now that you've kind of felt the waters with the data. But then about past"
5199,2021-08-26T13:46:55.388000+00:00,"Even here, saying something like 
```40% of the users would like to have more control over their inbox by setting preferences for the mails that they receive. ```
Is not an insight, it's an observation. An insight must always answer the 'why'.  What does it mean that 40% of the users want this? So 60% does not want it? Why do they want more control over their mailbox, if they want that why aren't they currently doing it already? 5 Why technique works great for insights"
5200,2021-08-26T12:53:09.051000+00:00,"also, these are the things that i did not do correctly, so what should be my next step? should i remove these questions or frame it in a way that forces the user to give answer based on the past experiences?"
5201,2021-08-26T12:50:26.582000+00:00,"also, i have started learning UI UX from past 3 months, and yes, i have to cover alot of things as yet..."
5202,2021-08-26T12:49:47.042000+00:00,"thanks a lot for the feedback, i actually got to learn something out of it and can work on it to present it better next time. and yes, this was the problem i was facing and thought that this could be my first case study for my UI UX portfolio"
5203,2021-08-26T12:48:33.817000+00:00,i will definitely check these out and try to understand what they are doing
5204,2021-08-26T12:47:45.998000+00:00,"yes, its in a different section- here it is https://faithful-scarer-7d9.notion.site/Strategy-plan-understanding-user-behaviors-and-analysing-insights-9562740a0f38423bb84d2146afd1778f"
5205,2021-08-26T12:46:24.315000+00:00,"this actually makes perfect sense, as it was my first time doing a case study, i was not aware about these things, i read 5 to 10 different case studies and prepared an outline and then started working on it"
5206,2021-08-26T12:45:19.636000+00:00,"this is not the actual text, its capturing raw thoughts as and when i was doing it"
5207,2021-08-26T11:44:50.243000+00:00,"But yeah, beside the critics, it's definitely a relevant problem I myself come across every morning as well!"
5208,2021-08-26T11:26:53.356000+00:00,"But to be fair, I couldn't have given feedback for point 1 if you wouldn't have presented those answers."
5209,2021-08-26T11:25:35.554000+00:00,"The data and stats are used as refs for the principles, but they're not the focus of what you communicate"
5210,2021-08-26T11:24:21.628000+00:00,"Not because there are actual 10 heuristic principles, but because this is a useful cluster to understand the data in terms of rules of thumb (without having to think for yourself)"
5211,2021-08-26T11:23:56.560000+00:00,They say: 10 Heuristic Principles
5212,2021-08-26T11:23:50.387000+00:00,See how organisations like NNGroup present their research
5213,2021-08-26T11:22:57.810000+00:00,https://www.designkit.org/methods/design-principles
5214,2021-08-26T11:22:29.188000+00:00,And

5216,2021-08-26T11:22:27.498000+00:00,A good method of translating answers is
5217,2021-08-26T11:21:06.424000+00:00,"Two: You are missing the translation of research / conclusion 

Your job as researcher is not presenting raw data, like stats, surveys, or papers or interviews transcripts. You as researcher is the only one who'd look at that, statistics is not a deliverable so to speak. I as reader shouldn't have to make my own conclusion based on your data. 

You want to present answers or decisions based on data, the data is the 'back-end' nobody needs to see that unless they don't trust you. The front-end is the answer like E=MC2"
5218,2021-08-26T11:13:28.924000+00:00,"One: the research is mainly framed at researching a future context. Questions such as:

```
What would make you unsubscribe from a mailing list?

Would you buy something if it is advertised on mail? In your opinion when would this work?

What features would you like to have in a spam blocking software?
```
or
```
What do you think of an app that solves this problem by giving back you the control of your inbox and keep it clean? What features do think this app should have?
```
Are all flawed questions. Thoughts of a future state is always hypothetical and almost always wrong. This has countless examples. People are very very bad at expecting how they'd like something, or what they want.

You always want to base a research question on something that has happened before, because that is proof, expectations are fictional situations that have never happened."
5219,2021-08-26T11:06:56.172000+00:00,I guess currently there are two major problems.
5220,2021-08-26T10:52:47.158000+00:00,"Just for some context, is this the text for the case study or to track your own research?"

I'm currently conducting initial research for my portfolio project (my prompt is to make a mobile app for homeless shelters) and I would really like to design something that could benefit the homeless population.

I've done some secondary research online about the challenges people face when becoming homeless and I've been trying to get some primary research going but I'm struggling to reach out to my target audience, who are people currently facing/have faced homelessness. So far, I've reached out to professionals who work with homeless people, messaged a few people on Reddit who are homeless, and made a post on the homeless subreddit to see if anyone is willing to share their experiences with me.

Are there better ways to go about researching? Anything I'm missing? I would greatly appreciate any suggestions!"

**Introduction:** Here you can give context to the research. Who/what is the client/product/person/subject? why was the research started? why is this important? Anything that gives the reader a good introduction about the context of the case really.

**Scope** What are we researching, or maybe even better, what are we not researching? 

**Primary Question:** A clear and concise question that you've hoped to have answered by the end of the research. For example ""How engaging is the <#746161708782977110> channel?"" (Be careful to not assume a problem in the question here, for example ""Why is the engagement decreasing"" would already be a leading question."" 

**Sub Question:** Think of at least three question that further specify the goals in this research, for example ""How engaging is the <#746161708782977110> compared to all the other channels"" ""What are the average messages sent in the <#746161708782977110> channel?"" Etc etc

**Methods** What methods am I going to employ in order to research this, and why are these good methods for this specific problem?

**Metrics** How do I actually measure what I want to know? 

**Scripts** This depends on the method, if it's a prototype test you have user scenarios and tasks. If it's interviews some key questions and all."

5313,2021-08-12T04:23:56.040000+00:00,"This is certainly a tough challenge, especially as a sole UXR. Something I've heard described that works as a process to tackle this, is this: pair with whoever is leading the product management or product ownership (i.e., whoever has a good idea of the direction of the product into the future). Pair with them to list out, in some level of detail, the types of features and things they are wanting to work towards, and talk with them about the unknowns of each to figure out what level of research contribution is needed for each.

For example, if this person can tell you that there is a near term urgent idea, that they already have ideas on and have gotten some validation around, your contribution as a UXR (and how it fits into your road map) is more on validation and testing. Less time commitment, this directs your participants /recruitment too. 
If one or more of the products/features are farther out and more unknown, that means you may need to assess how much generative/exploratative work needs to be done. Talk unknowns that they have that they need answered to move forward. Startups need value and people to remove blockers. 

This conversation can help start to form the road map for you, and assess where big unknowns are that need more discovery over testing. Incorporate this with a panel of users who can come in repeatedly (bi weekly for sprints, for example), can help take down the over head for you. Also, if you have designers who are research-competent, they can take on some of the quick usability testing.

5324,2021-08-09T15:32:15.178000+00:00,"That is the kind of conclusion I was looking for.  It may be niche for UX designers, but personally, trained as an architectural designer(tend to think in 3D) I feel it is a good place to start. What do you think about the job market? if you dont mind sharing some insights<:BlobThanks:853500879167684628>"
5325,2021-08-09T15:14:50.830000+00:00,"It is a niche skill, just got to look/find the right jobs. I can see it becoming a more common skill in a few years, especially for AR. and no google ux course (frankly none of the boot camps or ux courses) will teach you XR because it's a niche skill"
5326,2021-08-09T15:05:56.395000+00:00,"Thank you, this is a great example.  I also watched an eye-opening prototype here https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBL3xU7e35M&t=14s"
5327,2021-08-09T15:03:53.633000+00:00,"Wow for the list of resources! I just watched the video Mike Alger posted 7 years ago. It is amazing.  Hard to say if XR design is a sought after skill for UX designers or UX is an essential part of XR design.  I joined the google UX design course on coursera, assuming it will most likely teach only for products that are not XR oriented."
5328,2021-08-09T13:58:03.249000+00:00,"depends where u r in the world, but XR has been around for a long time, we're just starting to see more applications of it in a more consumer lens (but big company big risky projects really benefit from it), and that's not necessarily attached to UX Design.

5332,2021-08-09T12:41:32.546000+00:00,This is a cool one
5333,2021-08-09T12:38:51.833000+00:00,As it adds an extra layer of information on physical / physical smart products
5334,2021-08-09T12:38:11.846000+00:00,"But especially augmented reality is of most business value, I know that many big companies are investing in it currently"

5337,2021-08-08T19:53:58.086000+00:00,"Hi design buddies. I am an architectural/interior designer. in the past few years, I have been working for design companies, most of them have a VR headset covered with dirt. I personally believe architectural designers can do a lot more than drafting construction details with their skillsets. Making our design accessible to more people is what I am interested in. I found my way into UI/UX design and I am teaching myself  the fundamentals.  When I do my research about UI/UX, it appeals to be trendy for UI/UX designers to work on UX (VR,AR,MR) design.  If you are currently in the industry, what do you think on XR for UX?"
5338,2021-08-08T18:27:26.019000+00:00,Or just the good old SWOT üòÇ
5339,2021-08-08T18:22:19.585000+00:00,You can use DESTEP analysis which can be interesting
5340,2021-08-08T17:45:38.471000+00:00,Competitors can include direct and indirect competitors so that‚Äôs totally fine
5341,2021-08-08T17:04:17.724000+00:00,"As for 1, it will probably be better to look for apps that help users transition into different lifestyle choices, or to change behavior, or a diet change. I would also do a literature review about behavior change before so you can recognize what to look for."
5342,2021-08-08T13:08:15.672000+00:00,"Hello all! I'm working on a personal case study for an app that will help users transition into plant-based diets. I'm thinking of doing a competitor analysis to see what other apps do and how they do it differently, but I'm seeing more apps that give you recipes/help you identify which products are plant-based rather than assist you with the actual transition. So my question is:

1) Is it okay if my competitor analysis include these apps that are only tangentially related but not exactly?
2) How exactly can I ""analyze"" an app in a time-efficient manner - is it as simple as downloading it and scrolling through its offerings or will it require me to sit down with them for some time to really understand their individual effectiveness."

5344,2021-08-07T18:27:57.136000+00:00,UX Research came out of several different disciplines. UX theories and methods seems to me to mainly come from psychology. I would look into psychology research methods and especially cognitive psychology. Here is a paper that attempts to look at the theoretical foundations of ux research and practice: https://doi.org/10.1145/2212776.2223739
5345,2021-08-07T17:09:15.809000+00:00,Is it okay if I DM on discord?
5346,2021-08-07T16:59:29.423000+00:00,not sure where you are in your career but happy to try to answer any q's on the market research side of the biz
5347,2021-08-07T12:58:25.531000+00:00,"Huh, okay, really interesting. I think my problem right now when it comes to marketing and UX design is that I don't understand the science behind it. I'm comfortable making the content and UI design, but when it comes to research I could.......Use a lot of work. Since I was looking into market research, I noticed a lot of things overlapping"
5348,2021-08-07T06:17:44.785000+00:00,"(I work at a market research firm) we do a lot of UX research for many major tech companies, so the line is really quite blurry. The research methodologies are essentially the same, the difference is more about being a generalist vs. a specialist. But that, too, is not a clear cut dichotomy, as we have quite a few experienced UX researchers on staff and our teams that work on UX projects obviously develop a specialization over time. The difference, from my pov, is mostly what makes sense for a client to pay to outsource vs. do in house with a UX research specialist.  Of course some market research firms are very focused on a set of standard quant market research products (i.e., brand tracking, ad testing, etc.) and can't flex to accommodate UX research the same way a firm with a strong custom research & qual team can..."
5349,2021-08-06T23:43:19.205000+00:00,"OMG Thank you!!!! Dang, I guess this seems kinda common. I've been researching more into marketing to understand my job better and take stuff to the next level. Thank you for linking me to your convo"
5350,2021-08-06T23:37:48.894000+00:00,we had a similar conversation üôÇ

5352,2021-08-06T23:34:31.367000+00:00,"Is it just me, or does market research and UX research overlap a lot?"
5353,2021-08-05T23:29:31.806000+00:00,It is still in the prototype stage. I did get a lot of useful insights from a five second test I conducted. 50% of the tested participants didn't remember the CTA.
5354,2021-08-05T23:26:27.713000+00:00,Is the landing page live or at prototype stage? Conversion rate is behavioral metric so ideally you‚Äôd need to test it within the real product context. You can gather some first impressions through a 5sec test but you‚Äôd be measuring attitude and not necessarily conversions.
5355,2021-08-05T23:25:42.632000+00:00,I learned how important this part can be the hard way. Even a PDF of a written case study is definitely better.
5356,2021-08-05T17:23:05.337000+00:00,"You never know indeed, I had the same thing today. Often smaller companies don't really seem to have a definite recruiter interview because they are expensive, so they directly ask you to present your work."
5357,2021-08-05T14:53:00.336000+00:00,just dont scroll them through your website
5358,2021-08-05T14:52:54.274000+00:00,100% always having a presentation ready (Doesnt have to be powerpoint... Figma or PDF is fine too)
5359,2021-08-05T14:51:31.526000+00:00,"Thanks for the tips Kenny, I will prepare a PowerPoint presentation for it"
5360,2021-08-05T14:40:13.708000+00:00,as if you are explaining it to a friend of yours that doesnt know UXR
5361,2021-08-05T14:39:55.602000+00:00,make a powerpoint presentation and always have it ready and really just walk them through the process without using specialized terminologu
5362,2021-08-05T14:37:40.602000+00:00,"Hi! I had an interview for a UXR role with an in-house recruiter the other day after she contacted me on LinkedIn. On the interview, she asked me to present one of my case studies on the spot. I was not expecting that, I would have thought that is usually reserved for later interview stages with the hiring manager. Is this common? If so, how should one approach it? How can one adapt the case study presentation to a recruiter audience (who is unlikely to know the depth of the field)?"
5363,2021-08-05T13:59:42.883000+00:00,might be something on google...cause I know they do really good cohort analysis
5364,2021-08-05T13:57:39.064000+00:00,Especially if you're a student
5365,2021-08-05T13:57:24.445000+00:00,Sometimes if you just send a mail to a company they'll just tell you too
5366,2021-08-05T13:56:52.786000+00:00,"Especially very known brands often let their audience be known, Heineken for example"
5367,2021-08-05T13:54:41.610000+00:00,Some websites offer things like that for common brands
5368,2021-08-05T09:09:19.756000+00:00,"Hey, are there ways that let you know what the target audience of other business is?"
5369,2021-08-05T07:25:01.072000+00:00,"Hello! I wanted to test a landing page for conversion based on contacting people. What kind of testing should I be using and how should I test? Currently, I am trying the five minute test. Any help will be really appreciated"
5370,2021-08-04T09:57:29.868000+00:00,Got her on WhatsApp<:ayy:772350143705776130>
5371,2021-08-04T09:56:45.733000+00:00,"I have a very nice recruiter too, even got her private number"
5372,2021-08-04T09:55:10.475000+00:00,"Though, monday we'll see how far that will really take me. Last round at the research agency"
5373,2021-08-04T09:53:30.848000+00:00,"Yeah I was also valued for my attitude I suppose! They openly mentioned my lack of experience, but still decided to go forward anyway with the idea they'd just guide me. So that's nice."
5374,2021-08-04T09:09:37.887000+00:00,"It depends on the company you go for I think! I am very lucky my organisation brought me on more for my attitude than experience and saw me as someone they could train and mould into the UXR they want. but other companies will want as Dario said 3-5 years of experience. A good way to build experience that I've seen is to do case studies and build a portfolio. If you have any acquaintances starting or expanding a business offer free UXR services and do a case study on it. There are free design sprints you can take part in too Healthcare by Design is one which gives you some good experience and deliverables for your portfolio, also good for networking. 
Discord is definitely a good place to start and get involved in the community!"
5375,2021-08-04T08:11:00.679000+00:00,"But even then, just apply anyway and you might get lucky to find a company like a research agency that wants to guide you"
5376,2021-08-04T08:10:19.953000+00:00,"It's difficult for starters too, because they will have to invest in guiding you. And many companies that are looking for UXR want 3 - 5 years experience"
5377,2021-08-04T08:06:27.829000+00:00,"There are many roads I suppose. Some go through studies, like a master in behavioural psych. Some first become UX designers or service designers, then use their research experience. I did a 4 year study in interactive media design (or something similar) and just applied for many UXR positions and got to showcase what I've done and be enthusiastic about it."
5378,2021-08-03T20:10:19.541000+00:00,"Thanks Sherry, I'll go check it out!"

I'm also an aspiring UX Researcher trying to get more into the industry. I think you're in the right place by joining Design Buddies and trying to some connections here. I'm wondering if signed up for mentorships? I found that to be extremely helpful, and you can get direct one on one guidance and feedback from more experienced UX Researchers. <:MeowCoffee:711460582108168202>"
5380,2021-08-03T18:07:55.890000+00:00,"Hey all!
I'm new to the discord and I want to start a career in UX Research. I was going to ask this in career questions, but I wanted to network with UX researchers. My main question is, how do I get my foot in the door in this industry?"
5381,2021-08-03T15:58:09.717000+00:00,"Anyway, thanks <@!181895166460690432> !"
5382,2021-08-03T15:33:58.066000+00:00,And sadly the ability of machine learning to adapt fast to a new situation/information is very weak
5383,2021-08-03T15:33:27.737000+00:00,Result; criminals used this information to better plan their crime üòÇ
5384,2021-08-03T15:33:10.469000+00:00,So they could set more police to specific locations
5385,2021-08-03T15:32:47.424000+00:00,"There was also some attempt to catch criminals, using satellite data + some other data sets in order to fight crime, track areas with a lot of crime"
5386,2021-08-03T15:32:14.052000+00:00,"I guess that's often a thing in general, unexpected uses of either research or design"
5387,2021-08-03T15:18:45.882000+00:00,"cause this is ""what is risky to assume for this project"" vs ""what should this research used for/purpose"""
5388,2021-08-03T15:17:07.887000+00:00,its a combination of it
5389,2021-08-03T15:16:55.411000+00:00,
5390,2021-08-03T15:16:55.348000+00:00,probably not going to happen in this case... but like
5391,2021-08-03T15:16:49.512000+00:00,This thingy
5392,2021-08-03T15:16:46.432000+00:00,they were deemed liable...
5393,2021-08-03T15:16:42.324000+00:00,and because it didnt have that statement of teaching ppl how it should be used
5394,2021-08-03T15:16:33.367000+00:00,"this is an aside but long story short in engineering tort law, there was a case that there was this research conducted, then in the future ppl used the research wrong"
5395,2021-08-03T15:16:08.725000+00:00,probably also what the research should be used for as well and the intended scope of it
5396,2021-08-03T15:15:53.746000+00:00,I've once seen a matric graph for defiining that too
5397,2021-08-03T15:15:06.774000+00:00,"Makes sense, so just basically stating what you don't know"
5398,2021-08-03T15:13:37.954000+00:00,So that def makes sense now
5399,2021-08-03T15:13:26.488000+00:00,"But I was not just curious for it for my own context, just in general!"
5400,2021-08-03T15:13:15.183000+00:00,"Research question and sub-questions

5401,2021-08-03T15:12:39.668000+00:00,especially if it's something you're leaving behind and not having a debrief on
5402,2021-08-03T15:12:17.805000+00:00,"yea, it reallllyy comes down to expectations"
5403,2021-08-03T15:12:04.696000+00:00,from them
5404,2021-08-03T15:12:02.792000+00:00,what was in the scope document/ ask for your agency
5405,2021-08-03T15:11:43.089000+00:00,But I imagine then it still depends
5406,2021-08-03T15:11:34.765000+00:00,The designers itself are from another agency
5407,2021-08-03T15:11:26.107000+00:00,"Yeah, this context is really from a research agency"
5408,2021-08-03T15:10:12.318000+00:00,"Additionally, researchers feel an unnecessary pressure to provide those answers all. the. time. But I digress. A different conversation for a different day üôÇ"
5409,2021-08-03T15:09:05.519000+00:00,I think ive realized like Brian said it really depends org to org... in Facebook for examples researchers only provide data... whereas some orgs they provide recommendations to the designer
5410,2021-08-03T15:08:50.555000+00:00,This is incorrect and unhealthy
5411,2021-08-03T15:08:37.361000+00:00,That you are always expected to come up with answers
5412,2021-08-03T15:08:30.455000+00:00,"In my experience, research can sometimes be leaned on too heavily."

5414,2021-08-03T15:03:23.997000+00:00,Limitations in which sense?
5415,2021-08-03T15:01:37.619000+00:00,"Conversely, stating the limitations of your work upfront can also be valuable."
5416,2021-08-03T14:57:33.789000+00:00,I suppose they are giving design recs there
5417,2021-08-03T14:56:47.491000+00:00,"But yeah, I imagine the best thing is just ask them I suppose"
5418,2021-08-03T14:55:51.471000+00:00,"```Because we can choose from 6 cities at the start, we immediately get a familiar feeling and the idea that the app knows us. But despite the fact that we went through the onboarding quite smoothly, we miss a lot of information in advance that can allay our questions and concerns. There is a chance that this will cause users to interrupt the !ow, which leads to
can lead to less conversion. The visibility of the system status in the onboarding could also be improved. Show it number of steps and always explain these steps.

The app lacks a certain freedom of use. This has a negative effect on the user-friendliness. It having to verify the driving license (although completely necessary) at the moment can create a barrier to complete the onboarding. Give users the option to do this later.Furthermore, we cannot first view the app before signing up. This allows users to feel forced
feel to use the product. Therefore, be transparent about why this information must be entered to become. This increases the willingness to complete the onboarding.

After the onboarding we see a map unfold in front of us showing us all available e-scooters. It's now a matter of a few clicks to appropriate a sustainable shared scooter for a while.```"

5421,2021-08-03T14:53:34.822000+00:00,I guess that might be a good thing to ask indeed!

5423,2021-08-03T14:47:17.786000+00:00,"Some orgs will look to research to make those recos. Others prefer to take those insights and derive solutions from there. So the ""it depends"" answer is apt here."
5424,2021-08-03T14:39:06.954000+00:00,"but refer to my first point, which comes back to ""it depends"" on the context and your role"

5431,2021-08-03T14:19:38.680000+00:00,"As a purely UX researcher role, working with UX Designers (so a company culture where these roles are strictly divided) should reporting the research of lets say a usability test ever be framed as design advice? Or should it always remain a problem and keep any 'solution' space completely for the designers?

Example, imagine I find some usability issues regarding descriptions on a website. Lets say the descriptions are way too long. Should the only thing the UX researcher should say: ""The description is too long."" or could it also kind of include a possible solution like ""Maybe put it in bullet points."""

I think this covers what I learned about it in undergrad. Though it doesn't include anything about why ethics are very serious, as in the experiments that were unethical and what happened.

5439,2021-07-30T18:16:56.833000+00:00,I think thats a great visualization tool and training tool
5440,2021-07-30T18:16:46.503000+00:00,they also used it in radiation training for nuclear plants

5458,2021-07-30T18:11:46.070000+00:00,"yea, we got a lot of military funded projects"
5459,2021-07-30T18:11:28.366000+00:00,Like researching for the military?
5460,2021-07-30T18:11:21.014000+00:00,Military projects?
5461,2021-07-30T18:09:57.711000+00:00,"Yeah, they were more about how to algorithms can still be biased etc"

5471,2021-07-30T18:02:55.540000+00:00,This was in my second year of my study or so
5472,2021-07-30T18:02:16.768000+00:00,Assuming that if I got access to knowledge I could use it
5473,2021-07-30T18:00:22.697000+00:00,That's the day I learned about ethics in research
5474,2021-07-30T17:59:54.800000+00:00,So I called and got one of their children on the phone
5475,2021-07-30T17:59:19.647000+00:00,Then the lady just gave 5 phone numbers of other parents without their knowledge
5476,2021-07-30T17:59:07.256000+00:00,Was interviewing for parents with children with neurodevelopment disorders
5477,2021-07-30T17:58:29.256000+00:00,One time I accidentally got peoples house phone numbers
5478,2021-07-30T17:58:06.906000+00:00,"Yeah, research ethics is a big thing I suppose"
5479,2021-07-30T17:16:59.538000+00:00,"like, safety is a priority"
5480,2021-07-30T17:16:53.045000+00:00,but also what to ask vs what not to ask should be research 101
5481,2021-07-30T17:06:00.181000+00:00,E.g making the person feel comfortable enough to share personal info
5482,2021-07-30T17:04:26.522000+00:00,Like in interviewing there's a tons of psychology tricks in order to build a rapport with the person you're interviewing
5483,2021-07-30T17:03:45.571000+00:00,Still missing a lot of things
5484,2021-07-30T16:29:25.144000+00:00,"but even then, it depends on the company/org structure"
5485,2021-07-30T16:19:23.915000+00:00,"Yeah, idk the methodology used to create it or if it was tested for validity. It seems to be based on the level of autonomy the researcher has in the company."

5504,2021-07-28T16:13:29.746000+00:00,I think its fine to interview ppl you know
5505,2021-07-28T16:13:19.767000+00:00,and you follow that criteria or talk about why selecting your friends wouldnt give you any bias
5506,2021-07-28T16:13:05.996000+00:00,as long as you have your participant selection criteria
5507,2021-07-28T16:05:24.976000+00:00,i'm mostly using the surveys in hopes that people will give me their emails so I can actually interview them. It seems like interview my friends won't look that good on my portfolio as someone who's trying to transition into UX

5509,2021-07-28T15:58:48.869000+00:00,from those you can determine if u need to do an interview to get the actual insights for your open ended questions
5510,2021-07-28T15:58:11.236000+00:00,yeah but what you can do from surveys is get good short qualitative data like ratings and etc
5511,2021-07-28T15:53:28.760000+00:00,i'm rather long-winded
5512,2021-07-28T15:53:18.584000+00:00,"yea, like if I got that survey, i would probably write alot more than the person that test piloted my survey"
5513,2021-07-28T15:49:53.334000+00:00,thats the challenge with surveys and open ended long questions
5514,2021-07-28T15:49:24.872000+00:00,"yea, I test piloted my survey and they didn't take that much time thinking and writing an answer for each question"

5516,2021-07-27T18:34:44.057000+00:00,Drop-off rate is normally about 10% + (2% per 100 items). I would do some pilot studies to get feedback and actual times to give people a range.
5517,2021-07-27T16:24:49.910000+00:00,Ok. I think my current survey is shorter than 10 minutes

5565,2021-07-27T13:18:25.567000+00:00,Cool! I've never seen this before! Thank you!
5566,2021-07-27T13:17:35.344000+00:00,I'm too lazy to read back if someone has mentioned this.. I think the Lean survey canvas can help üôÇ
5567,2021-07-27T13:16:49.415000+00:00,I currently lack a prototype to actually do user testing. My survey was just to see what other problems people have.  Other than the ones I already have
5568,2021-07-27T13:15:23.108000+00:00,"With long surveys be sure to add trick questions, so you know when people aren't reading anymore"
5569,2021-07-27T13:14:11.823000+00:00,"Not exactly a survey, but Maze gives you these guidelines for user testing. Not sure it it helps üôÇ"
5570,2021-07-27T13:13:06.003000+00:00,"Surveys shouldn't take more than just a few minutes too, so maybe 10 questions is great, 5 questions is even better."
5571,2021-07-27T13:11:42.028000+00:00,"Well, for one surveys and open-ended questions are usually a bad idea for surveys. But generally, the length of the survey will increase how many people you need. So the shorter the survey, the fewer people required. Also the larger the surveys, the more bloated and inaccurate the answer will be."
5572,2021-07-27T12:09:43.634000+00:00,"hi...is there anyone who's good at doing research
i need help"

5574,2021-07-27T11:16:06.120000+00:00,how many questions are too many in a survey? most of my questions are open-ended questions
5575,2021-07-27T08:53:03.850000+00:00,"It highly depends on your 'pool' of people and diversity of the pool for people. The more diverse the pool, the more you need."
5576,2021-07-27T08:52:05.587000+00:00,"Or in general with voting, the vote is only valid when a certain % of people have voted"
5577,2021-07-27T08:51:49.008000+00:00,"For example, some government surveys are only valid when like 50K people respond"
5578,2021-07-27T08:50:29.630000+00:00,"Yeah, it highly depends..."
5579,2021-07-27T04:34:10.158000+00:00,"Like sure if you have no budget, but otherwise why would you accept such a large margin of error, and not being able to cut your data in any meaningful way"

5584,2021-07-23T16:48:14.844000+00:00,I see - thanks for the clarification. Sounds like good advice!
5585,2021-07-23T16:46:42.715000+00:00,"No, it's good for starting out on a first personal project that is meant for learning about the process and to use it to ease into interviewing people if you are anxious about it. I would add to acknowledge that it was a convenience sample and definitely not use friends for a serious project."
5586,2021-07-23T07:50:01.172000+00:00,Yeah it's a great way to start practicing interviewing
5587,2021-07-23T07:14:32.527000+00:00,trolling?
5588,2021-07-22T19:49:18.923000+00:00,"Friends are also great resources for getting people to interview. It can also be a great excuse to reconnect with people. I prefer to interview as if I do not know the person in ""interviewer"" mode.

5589,2021-07-22T07:32:04.062000+00:00,"Just ask people whom you've talked before in this server or outside, 9/10 will say yes"

5591,2021-07-22T07:30:57.289000+00:00,But most beginning UX students do surveys because the step of actually talking to people / interviewing face to face seems to scary
5592,2021-07-22T07:29:47.067000+00:00,I mean it's ok if you just want to do surveys for the sake of surveys
5593,2021-07-22T07:22:22.797000+00:00,"They are useful for demographic information maybe, which is more useful for marketing. Or to validate earlier qual research, or maybe some desirability research. But not in anyway will they give valuable unexpected new insights."
5594,2021-07-22T07:20:18.243000+00:00,"You can't make personas, empathy maps or user journeys with surveys"
5595,2021-07-22T07:15:42.509000+00:00,Much more valuable actually talking to people though. What's stopping you? You're in a server with many people!
5596,2021-07-21T17:58:26.180000+00:00,"np but its up to you to determine when do you have enough information, what do you need and etc"

5598,2021-07-21T17:46:54.077000+00:00,"if you want to know their favourite brands, ask their favourite brands (but this is something personally i wouldnt do in a targeted survey more maybe in interviews)"
5599,2021-07-21T17:46:26.093000+00:00,"eg if you need to know an age range for your persona, that should be one of the questions"
5600,2021-07-21T17:46:06.992000+00:00,you just have to make sure that the questions will allow you to analyze and understand what your target user is like
5601,2021-07-21T17:45:44.824000+00:00,"the thing you should watch out for is how you ask the question and the type of questions. Surveys if you have too many open ended questions and long format, ppl may be more reluctant to answer and complete it if theres no financial reward"
5602,2021-07-21T17:44:51.814000+00:00,theres a lot of different communities you can go to to post Surveys but it defintely is a mini project in itself to recruit ppl
5603,2021-07-21T17:43:17.590000+00:00,And what about where to find people willing to answer them? And what is worth paying attention to while creating them? Sorry for so many questionsüôà
5604,2021-07-21T17:41:19.800000+00:00,for surveys? Google survey and etc are some nice free resources
5605,2021-07-21T17:40:53.593000+00:00,Smart answer. Then do you have any recommendations or resources on how to conduct them? üòÖ
5606,2021-07-21T17:09:13.426000+00:00,it depends on what you think of the risk of not confirming or knowing üôÇ
5607,2021-07-21T17:03:46.463000+00:00,How to determine what target users are?
5608,2021-07-21T17:03:10.933000+00:00,But is it worth it to do a survey if I probably couldn‚Äôt get much answers? Or do you have any tips on surveys?
5609,2021-07-21T16:51:41.213000+00:00,Or research what target users your competitors are doing
5610,2021-07-21T16:51:27.705000+00:00,You can potentially get that from surveys for example
5611,2021-07-21T16:38:12.980000+00:00,And what that data is?
5612,2021-07-21T15:28:41.086000+00:00,otherwise you could run the risk of confirmational bias but thats it
5613,2021-07-21T15:28:31.340000+00:00,the target audience should be fairly clear or up to you to select. as long as the designs are backed up by decisions and data of some sort I think its fine?
5614,2021-07-21T14:50:22.933000+00:00,"I think that design can take a lot of paths, and if you're already having ideas you should capture them, then you can always do further research to refine assumptions and such."
5615,2021-07-21T14:34:44.491000+00:00,"Actually, I'm not sure. Data that shows what target audience could be? I have a lot of ideas for future phases of design, but I'm stuck on research. But no wonders for that if I don't even know what I want to find from it üòÖ"
5616,2021-07-21T14:09:41.533000+00:00,What‚Äôs the real data you‚Äôre having trouble getting?
5617,2021-07-21T12:43:53.572000+00:00,Or is it not necessarry for ux case study?
5618,2021-07-21T12:26:06.054000+00:00,"Hey guys. I'm asking for help cause I already feel overwhelmed üòÖ I'm trying to do ux case study (my passion project). I've already done competitor analysis and found that people love these types of products but they still have flaws. I believe that I need to to research before moving on to personas, empathy maps or other methods. Could you please give me an advice on what's the right and not too difficult way to get the real data? I was thinking about surveys, but I probably wouldn't get enough answers."
5619,2021-07-20T19:18:51.049000+00:00,"I'm just thinking if I'm going to be doing this I'd rather make a bunch of changes at once and then let the test run, I don't have bandwidth (or permission haha) to do several tests on different aspects over weeks."
5620,2021-07-20T19:17:55.688000+00:00,"That is fair, I'm sort of in an argument with management because they like the way the page looks/works now but it has a lot of bad practices that I want to fix. So a redesign with proof of better engagement is what I'm after. It's *soooo fun* being the only designer üôÉ"
5621,2021-07-20T19:10:11.503000+00:00,"simple example: contrast, increasing/changing contrast in one area will be better because that's just good design...no need to test"
5622,2021-07-20T19:09:32.942000+00:00,"you can also use ""established design patterns"" as a baseline for improvement"
5623,2021-07-20T19:09:26.152000+00:00,they arent really mutually exclusive in terms of process
5624,2021-07-20T19:09:11.771000+00:00,to see if they made a difference because that can affect how you redesign it as well
5625,2021-07-20T19:08:58.423000+00:00,along the way you can test the individual changes separately
5626,2021-07-20T19:08:36.852000+00:00,"Ah right that makes sense, that isn't A/B testing that's just like, normal testing, looking at the metrics. Thanks!"
5627,2021-07-20T19:05:48.050000+00:00,it would show that you have improved the designs however
5628,2021-07-20T19:05:33.496000+00:00,"its not really an ""A/B"" test"
5629,2021-07-20T19:05:27.490000+00:00,and what really made the difference so overall sure you can compare the two and the results but like you said
5630,2021-07-20T19:05:06.340000+00:00,"essentially like Magz said, if you do all the changes together you dont actually know what change worked well"
5631,2021-07-20T19:04:46.995000+00:00,"this also helps!

5632,2021-07-20T19:04:32.331000+00:00,A/B is mainly for small or focused differences
5633,2021-07-20T19:04:18.960000+00:00,I think you have the right understanding about A/B testing and it doesn't sound like it'd benefit your case.
5634,2021-07-20T19:02:44.904000+00:00,"Hi there, sorry if this is the wrong place to ask, but I've got some questions on A/B testing. I have a poorly designed, fairly low-traffic page that I want to redesign and test to see if I actually made a difference. I've never done any A/B testing before, and from a few articles it looks like I shouldn't be testing with huge differences between the variations, just changing one aspect and comparing. 

I feel like it would make more sense with this already low-traffic page that has a lot of potential usability and UX issues to just do the overhaul and measure the change in engagement. It sounds like most of the time A/B testing is for finding out if a ""small"" detail makes a difference like what media or what layout you use. But in this case I'm just purely trying to prove that I could make a better design than what exists. Is this a research rule I'm breaking, will I get inconclusive results if I make a lot of changes? I'm using the built in A/B tester of our CMS, by the way."
5635,2021-07-20T11:35:15.186000+00:00,Thank you so much!
5636,2021-07-20T11:34:15.311000+00:00,"Anyway, good luck! Sounds like a fun idea!"
5637,2021-07-20T11:32:11.108000+00:00,Not price drops / discounts
5638,2021-07-20T11:31:57.661000+00:00,"Yeah! So in the trend canvas, notifications can be the focus of research I suppose."
5639,2021-07-20T11:29:49.016000+00:00,"Yes, you're definitely right about this"
5640,2021-07-20T11:29:01.016000+00:00,"But in your case, notifications applied to price changes"
5641,2021-07-20T11:28:40.568000+00:00,I think a lot of brands gives an ability to get notified when something is back in stock
5642,2021-07-20T11:28:28.372000+00:00,Notify me trend
5643,2021-07-20T11:28:19.528000+00:00,Trend of notifications
5644,2021-07-20T11:28:11.716000+00:00,Is the same thing!
5645,2021-07-20T11:28:05.311000+00:00,Even Discord sending me a notification when someone pings me
5646,2021-07-20T11:27:34.391000+00:00,"So the trend is not; getting an email when my size is in stock, it's being able to 'track' item information without having to look for yourself"
5647,2021-07-20T11:26:43.655000+00:00,If your size is in stock again**
5648,2021-07-20T11:26:22.168000+00:00,"You can get an email, when it's back in stock again"
5649,2021-07-20T11:26:13.554000+00:00,"Also, at Zalando, when an item is out of sell"
5650,2021-07-20T11:25:33.590000+00:00,"So my watching trends in one industry, you can predict them in another. That's why looking outside the scope of your own industry is so important"
5651,2021-07-20T11:24:43.476000+00:00,"The trend is like a big wave, hitting different industries at a different time."
5652,2021-07-20T11:24:05.509000+00:00,The point of trend watching innovation is finding upcoming trends in certain industries and adopting it to another
5653,2021-07-20T11:23:25.584000+00:00,Yeah! Try and see if 'reminders' that you can track something is used outside the scope of retail
5654,2021-07-20T11:23:00.819000+00:00,You're probably right. I've checked only trends of retail
5655,2021-07-20T11:22:43.848000+00:00,Is the same trend
5656,2021-07-20T11:22:41.525000+00:00,LinkedIn reminding you a job position is open
5657,2021-07-20T11:22:34.371000+00:00,In context of a different industry
5658,2021-07-20T11:22:23.323000+00:00,It's sort of the trend of tracking / reminders
5659,2021-07-20T11:22:03.726000+00:00,And I'm confused what trend is behind this
5660,2021-07-20T11:21:51.806000+00:00,"My idea is a product, where you can paste a link of an item and get notified when the price changes."
5661,2021-07-20T11:21:41.580000+00:00,"Yeah the trend is a movement though! A trend is not one idea, it's an idea behind and idea. So coupons by itself is not a trend"
5662,2021-07-20T11:20:33.368000+00:00,"I think that it has a trend similar to it. Actually there are similar products to my idea, but they have limitations. I'm aware about them. But my case study is just for portfolio, so I thought I would go for it."
5663,2021-07-20T11:18:51.666000+00:00,"Also it helps to really think about the core of your idea. If I remember correctly, you said something about cheap deals. There are many examples of that in different industries"
5664,2021-07-20T11:16:30.524000+00:00,"But it could be that your idea / trend doesn't exist. While generally people think it's got if something doesn't exist in innovation, it's usually a bad sign. Because that means either you're genius and are 1 / 1000000000 who thought about that, or it's a bad business idea, because no business has survived doing it (which is why it can't be found)."
5665,2021-07-20T11:09:36.298000+00:00,"So if your idea has to do with travelling, try and look at trends outside the scope of travelling"
5666,2021-07-20T11:08:57.963000+00:00,Also try to look outside the scope of your industry
5667,2021-07-20T11:07:51.583000+00:00,Probably look up trend reports! Often you can find a lot there in these reports!
5668,2021-07-20T10:30:45.424000+00:00,"Hey, <@!209640428151111680> . You told me about consumer trend canvas yesterday. Do you have any tips on how to find the right trend? I'm struggling with it, I found about coupons trend but nothing that would really suit my idea."

5672,2021-07-20T02:17:26.670000+00:00,"In terms of surveys, I'm not sure if you will be able to ask the right questions on text to have them be answered. Surveys can lose context and it sounds like you're looking to fill in qualitative (emotional, behavioral) context from the literature review you've done. Also, they may take time as well to get responses!"
5673,2021-07-20T02:00:49.588000+00:00,"yeah thats a fair point, i wouldnt have recommended it to replace speaking to children"
5674,2021-07-20T01:59:38.977000+00:00,Which I guess makes sense since we'll never know what our target audience wants unless we talk to them üòÖ
5675,2021-07-20T01:58:59.351000+00:00,"We've tried doing some form of a literature review as a base line, but some of the mentors are particularly adamant about us needing to actually speak with some of our potential user base since it's more of an ""innovation"" project where we have to consider stakeholders, value proposition, etc."
5676,2021-07-20T01:54:44.410000+00:00,it seems like for that topic there might be a lot of learning models and studies conducted on it
5677,2021-07-20T01:54:30.235000+00:00,have you check out any research papers on this
5678,2021-07-20T01:54:05.490000+00:00,Youtube vlogs sound like a good alternative! My team is also possibly considering surveys just so that we can understand the problem from both their parents and the children (we're trying to develop ways children with physical disabilities can take part in inclusive playtime) - do you think they would be just as effective?
5679,2021-07-20T01:49:52.528000+00:00,"Sounds like a fun project! Beyond interviews, I like watching Youtube vlogs and reading blogs to understand more about their life. It may not showcase the whole journey/day but you can definitely have a general idea of what their day looks like. (Make sure that it's not sponsored or something, I watch non-influencer videos/blogs. Like real-life ones). 

If you're looking for a quick conversation, I would go out to parks and malls. Parents are there with their children and they may be open for a short interview!"
5680,2021-07-20T01:14:11.416000+00:00,"Hello! My team and I are trying to get in touch with potential users (children) to interview them for this bootcamp project we are doing but we are not sure if we are able to get responses quickly enough due to time constraints since we only have two weeks left to interview users and develop a prototype as a result (and we'll have to get permission from their parents to let them partake in our interview) - what are other ways we could get the insights that we need (eg. what are their pain points, what is their day-to-day, etc)?"
5681,2021-07-19T15:54:18.888000+00:00,"I mean you can do generative research in terms of what the game genre is and start interviewing users, but if you are making wireframes you can do cognitive walkthroughs on those with low fidelity wireframes"
5682,2021-07-19T14:57:27.984000+00:00,I'm just copying the UI that was already made in the game and trying to make it look better.
5683,2021-07-19T14:56:58.632000+00:00,"Yeah, so I wanted to know how do you do user research when you're making a game? I'm not sure of the process. Right now, I'm making wireframes in adobe XD & gonna make a prototype soon. But I think I'm skipping some steps regarding user research. I don't know the process of it, and the only people testing the game is me and my friend, who is also making the game."
5684,2021-07-19T14:54:24.962000+00:00,Any specific questions or it's mainly how it's conducted in general? <@!479437458187091970>
5685,2021-07-19T14:53:46.318000+00:00,what's up?
5686,2021-07-19T14:53:41.975000+00:00,me
5687,2021-07-19T14:29:32.026000+00:00,I'll post this question in there even though it's a combo of games ux & user research. I'm just trying to figure out how to do user research for games.
5688,2021-07-19T14:28:01.331000+00:00,also <#738996996744151080>  we have ppl in there

5690,2021-07-19T14:25:09.614000+00:00,"I am very sorry if this is considered a very stupid question and maybe I can google this. I have no idea what I am doing or where to start. But does anyone in here knows how to do user research for games? I am currently making UX wireframes for a game I'm making in adobe xd. Right now I'm just......winging it. I am gonna make a prototype of it soon. But I'm wondering if I'm doing it right. I haven't done any UX research and I'm afraid I'm doing everything wrong.
the only people who are testing the game demos right now are me and a friend who is also making the games"
5691,2021-07-19T14:17:24.024000+00:00,Just take it as perspective rather than fact
5692,2021-07-19T14:17:10.418000+00:00,But no problem either way! ‚ù§Ô∏è
5693,2021-07-19T14:16:36.981000+00:00,"Well just know I'm a recent grad too, so maybe my advise isn't really worth any money"
5694,2021-07-19T14:16:04.860000+00:00,thanks for sharing this knowledge with me. Usually you have to pay for this. I'm not saying that paying for knowledge is bad. I want to say that I appreciate the fact that you share this selflessly.
5695,2021-07-19T14:15:02.238000+00:00,It's elicitation technique / manipulation to get more data
5696,2021-07-19T14:14:22.429000+00:00,"So if doesn't really matter whether it's a 3 or 4. It just creates of feeling of someone needing to validate their thoughts, which can sometimes give more data. Otherwise when directly asking they will just say ""Yes"" or ""No not really"""
5697,2021-07-19T14:13:08.378000+00:00,"Yes, it's relative. But the point is not to be concrete, it's to indirectly being able to dig deeper later on."
5698,2021-07-19T14:12:19.625000+00:00,1-5 is weird imo because its relative and tbh everyones scale is different just something to consider its not a bad method of gauging how ppl feel towards something though
5699,2021-07-19T14:10:04.191000+00:00,"But even then, some people just really enjoy to complain for the sake of complaining."
5700,2021-07-19T14:09:23.189000+00:00,"So it's more important while analysing the interview data I suppose. That's why sometimes the number 1  - 5 can be useful, because it gives a nice binary thought on whether they really disliked / liked it."
5701,2021-07-19T14:07:07.959000+00:00,"The maybe in a later research you will find out they don't care about their privacy, but actually they don't like to be surprised that someone got their data without them knowing about it."
5702,2021-07-19T14:05:25.470000+00:00,"It can still be valuable to ask someone why they displayed a certain behaviour, but it's important to validate it further in follow up research to see if you can measure the opposite effect happening. This is more an analysing data issue, rather than just asking a question a certain way. 

For example someone might say ""I care very much about my privacy, so I don't like people seeing all my data! Facebook is evil!"" But then in a next study they'll use LogIn with facebook and are ok with sharing their data. 

The difficult thing then is that there's is contrasting data, one where they do care about data privacy but another where they don't care about data privacy. Then the difficult goal of the researcher is to find out in which context does someone care about privacy, and which do they not?"
5703,2021-07-19T13:57:13.236000+00:00,"based on Introspection illusion, it is better not to ask a person why he did or did not do it, as their judgment about their behavior is not reliable. Am I right or I do not quite understand the meaning ?"
5704,2021-07-19T12:06:22.605000+00:00,"But also ensure associative thinking, for better memory. 
- What time of the day was it?
- How was the weather like while you were doing this?
- Were you alone? 
- Did you talk to anyone about the events?"
5705,2021-07-19T12:04:54.326000+00:00,"Just a rough example, probably not the best questions either."
5706,2021-07-19T12:04:38.886000+00:00,"Yeah, long story short. Ask what people do, or did. 

- Have you ever looked for an event online?
- Where did you look? / Did you use an app for that?
- Why did you look there? / Have you looked at any alternatives?
- What made you choose alternative X over Y 
- What steps did you take?
- Why did you take those steps?
- What rating would you give this method 1 - 5?
- Why that rating?
- Why is that important to you? (5 Why technique applied)"
5707,2021-07-19T11:48:22.072000+00:00,I think I got it
5708,2021-07-19T11:47:29.078000+00:00,If that makes sense...
5709,2021-07-19T11:47:25.365000+00:00,"Behaviour is the displayed action. So, you are writing a question on a discord about X or Y. 

You feeling confused is an emotion that arises during this question. 

While this confusion is interesting, what is more important is what is the thing I'm doing wrong to cause confusion for you."
5710,2021-07-19T11:42:30.169000+00:00,I am a little confused about behavior and emotions.  If a question aimed at an emotion is: 'How are you feeling?'  then what does the question on behavior sound like?
5711,2021-07-19T11:39:37.993000+00:00,"You want to know what they did and how they did it, what they used, and why they used that over something else"
5712,2021-07-19T11:39:18.377000+00:00,"Try behavioural oriented questions, not feely oriented questions"
5713,2021-07-19T11:39:13.955000+00:00,"Thank you so much, I will think about how to fix this."
5714,2021-07-19T11:38:00.820000+00:00,Basically you want to avoid these things as much as you can
5715,2021-07-19T11:37:06.650000+00:00,"Check things like:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Introspection_illusion
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empathy_gap"
5716,2021-07-19T11:36:11.511000+00:00,"You don't want to know opinions about how they feel about finding events, you want to know their objective behaviour before their subjective experience, because how they feel about something is often just plainly wrong."
5717,2021-07-19T11:35:13.477000+00:00,"Much better! I guess `What is your relationship with creating an event?` is a bit vague though. 

Also `How do you feel about finding an event?` is also vague. When you ask people how they feel about something, they will get into the wrong type of thinking and feed their own bias. At least when you do it at the start"
5718,2021-07-19T10:15:44.884000+00:00,"what do you think about these questions?

Interview for 1 type of users (those who create and organise events)

Questions:

1.    What is your relationship with creating an event?
2.    Tell me about the last time you created and organized an event. 
3.    How did you plan the event?
4.    Between 1 - 5, how did the planning go? 
5.    Did you use any programs or apps when creating and organizing the event?
6.    What are the pros and cons of this program in your opinion?


Interview for 2 types of users (those who are looking for events)

Questions:
How do you feel about finding an event?
Tell us when you last searched for an event. (
how did you look for event?
Between 1 - 5, how was the search? 
Did you use any programs or apps when searched the event?
What are the pros and cons of this program in your opinion?"
5719,2021-07-19T09:10:46.120000+00:00,Yes. For those who create and organise events
5720,2021-07-19T07:34:56.890000+00:00,Which one? This: `Learn how people organise events. What difficulties do they face and how do they solve them.` ?
5721,2021-07-19T07:33:53.118000+00:00,"Thank you very much for your feedback, I'll try to rework my questions now. Can you please give feedback on the goals that I set for each interview."
5722,2021-07-19T07:33:35.151000+00:00,This is priming by the way: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Priming_(psychology)
5723,2021-07-19T07:27:14.886000+00:00,"A good rule of thumb is, don't ask much about someones experience, emotion or opinion. Those are all very vague and subjective, too easy to influence. Just someone having a bad day will already change how someone thinks about something that happened a while ago (even if they didn't actually experience that)

Talk about behaviour, concrete results, and they will add emotion themselves. I guess you can always ask about emotion, but only after they've clearly stated the behaviour and even then take it with a grain of salt."
5724,2021-07-19T07:23:31.207000+00:00,"People don't remember events well, you as interviewer can bring up memory by associative thinking"
5725,2021-07-19T07:22:45.361000+00:00,The introduction is very important though
5726,2021-07-19T07:21:32.960000+00:00,"Your questions currently are leading questions. For example: `Tell us, how often do you organise events?` is already priming someone to be someone who creates events often. Same with `How often do you search for events?` You're also priming someone to think as event as difficult, which again is influencing the person you're interviewing. Also `What difficulties did you face when searching for an event?` makes people think very hard about the difficulties, even if it went very very well.

A better way would be to ask question that relate to the persons time he/she created an event. For example:

`When was the last time you organised an event? (Though, still has the assumption this person ever organised an event)`

`What type of event? What was the weather like? Which time of day? How many people?` (Questions to try and bring up associative thinking)

Now in order to find 'difficulties' it's very important you do not talk about difficulties, they need to talk about difficulties. Ask behavioural questions that do not indicate it was either difficult or easy.

`How did you plan the event?`

`Between 1 - 5, how did the planning go?` 

Then if it's a 4, ask them to further explain that number

5728,2021-07-18T20:56:12.505000+00:00,I think that‚Äôs a great example of which you used a great attitudinal tool vs behavior but I think as long as a UXR keeps in mind that there are many different tools and go back to the basics of what are they trying to really achieve and understand
5729,2021-07-18T09:43:59.609000+00:00,"Because people did mind, but for other reasons"
5730,2021-07-18T09:43:38.926000+00:00,Introducing Coca Cola classic again
5731,2021-07-18T09:43:31.080000+00:00,Hence making people very angry for very irrational reasons
5732,2021-07-18T09:43:23.533000+00:00,"Removing Coca Cola from the market, since the quantitative research let people know that nobody minds the difference between cola light and cola"
5733,2021-07-18T09:42:34.796000+00:00,Same with all the taste tests done by coca cola
5734,2021-07-18T09:41:27.079000+00:00,"Meaning that the actual problem is often just the completely wrong one, hence you need to start exploring the options before focussing on the wrong problem, avoiding wasting your research time"
5735,2021-07-18T09:40:20.217000+00:00,But the solution was letting people know when they come by placing a clock that counts down the numbers
5736,2021-07-18T09:39:58.916000+00:00,"This time trains were too slow, so they increased the number of trains"
5737,2021-07-18T09:39:46.241000+00:00,Or clocks at the station
5738,2021-07-18T09:39:34.158000+00:00,Again gained by qualitative
5739,2021-07-18T09:39:27.097000+00:00,"However, people just want something to do, so they put mirrors in them instead"
5740,2021-07-18T09:38:46.842000+00:00,The initial problem was that people thought elevators were too slow
5741,2021-07-18T09:38:28.827000+00:00,"Or in elevators, they put mirrors"
5742,2021-07-18T09:38:00.228000+00:00,It was selling sun panels to neighbourhoods instead of households
5743,2021-07-18T09:37:42.533000+00:00,Thus the solution wasn't making sun panels more beautiful
5744,2021-07-18T09:37:30.820000+00:00,"Turns out the actual problem was; they didn't found sun panels ugly, they'd be scared their neighbours would be judgemental about ugly sun panels on their roof"
5745,2021-07-18T09:35:55.799000+00:00,Or there was a case where people found sun panels ugly to place on their roofs
5746,2021-07-18T09:31:52.254000+00:00,I wouldn't have discovered that if I used quant methods
5747,2021-07-18T09:31:24.251000+00:00,Actually implying that bad water quality is the preferred one
5748,2021-07-18T09:30:47.897000+00:00,"For example, one time I had to do research to water quality management. Qualitative research gave me the insight that by optimising the water quality the plants would start to grow extremely fast, making it impossible to get through with any boats, making it icky to swim in, and making it impossible to fish in"
5749,2021-07-17T21:57:54.870000+00:00,Exploratory implies that you are starting from scratch. Having conversion rates to increase implies that it is evaluative research.
5750,2021-07-17T20:51:49.315000+00:00,You pick the tools you need to understand don‚Äôt always have the leisure of full qual research
5751,2021-07-17T20:49:10.896000+00:00,Breadth vs Depth
5752,2021-07-17T20:48:59.180000+00:00,Conversion rate can be UXR depending on users attitudes
5753,2021-07-17T20:43:29.588000+00:00,It can't be exploratory if it doesn't explore though
5754,2021-07-17T20:41:44.315000+00:00,"That's not UXR though, that's sales / sales funnel optimisation\"
5755,2021-07-17T19:44:14.460000+00:00,That will be your main quant metric to go by
5756,2021-07-17T19:44:02.865000+00:00,If your boss says hey we want to increase conversion rate
5757,2021-07-17T19:43:24.828000+00:00,And it all depends on your stakeholders goals
5758,2021-07-17T19:43:15.352000+00:00,Some quant depending on the quant has no intrinsic biases as well that‚Äôs the thing
5759,2021-07-17T19:42:24.997000+00:00,"If you have budgets and time, sure it's probably always ideal to do as much qual as you can before and after a survey. But when is that the case üòÑ"
5760,2021-07-17T19:40:49.452000+00:00,It depends on the question you are trying to answer and how much you already know about the context...
5761,2021-07-17T19:21:22.795000+00:00,"I think that order does matter. Quant needs to be seeded by something that is not your own assumptions. It is not magic, the output depends on the input and the operations performed. Lit review or some qualitative will probably work."
5762,2021-07-17T18:08:04.006000+00:00,The order doesn‚Äôt matter that much it‚Äôs still in exploratory phase
5763,2021-07-17T18:07:51.198000+00:00,Well I was just saying how doing quant before qual is also ok
5764,2021-07-17T17:03:45.117000+00:00,Because there's no point in seeking direction if you've not looked at which directions exist
5765,2021-07-17T17:03:32.013000+00:00,"I mean, the order of doing qualitative before quantitative"
5766,2021-07-17T17:03:06.358000+00:00,Isn't that basically what it says here?
5767,2021-07-17T17:02:24.099000+00:00,If you just do qual you can spend too much time and too broad and you can‚Äôt get all the details you need
5768,2021-07-17T17:00:38.474000+00:00,Quant is only direction then by doing qual that still won‚Äôt kill any ideas
5769,2021-07-17T17:00:15.991000+00:00,It‚Äôs a cycle you first use quant to see any directions then do the research to see and cycle back to generative
5770,2021-07-17T16:56:19.362000+00:00,That with openmindeness you get generative research through quantitative methods?
5771,2021-07-17T16:55:27.954000+00:00,What exactly are you saying?
5772,2021-07-17T15:50:03.112000+00:00,"in a nutshell sometimes you cant only focus on the ""voice of the customer"" you have to also take ""voice of the process"" into account"
5773,2021-07-17T15:35:47.514000+00:00,those are where problems pivot
5774,2021-07-17T15:35:42.975000+00:00,as long as someone is open minded during research and not throwing out any new discoveries I dont see why it will kill abilities to find the unexpected
5775,2021-07-17T15:35:05.090000+00:00,"when youre doing qual, sometimes its so broad without quant you dont know what areas you should be focusing"
5776,2021-07-17T15:34:47.117000+00:00,"its a huge ""it depends"" cant say one is more than the other"
5777,2021-07-17T15:34:08.093000+00:00,depends on how you use the quant. the quant measures I often use are more problem spaces or justifying if the problem is even worth investigating
5778,2021-07-17T14:30:32.031000+00:00,"So if it's a new topic you're researching, starting quantitative would be ineffective. Because you don't know what you don't know, so why waste on metrics that might not even be the interesting one."
5779,2021-07-17T14:17:07.758000+00:00,So the generative side of research.
5780,2021-07-17T14:16:22.916000+00:00,But the problem of first using quant is that you kill the ability to find what you didn't expect. Quant can only give you information about what you already know you should be measuring.
5781,2021-07-17T14:15:35.550000+00:00,The order depends on the type of research I suppose.
5782,2021-07-17T11:32:16.703000+00:00,I don‚Äôt know if there‚Äôs a specific order because I‚Äôve had multiple times where using the quant results I knew what to ask in qual and dive deeper
5783,2021-07-17T07:30:59.454000+00:00,Using surveys as a means to try and disprove the data gotten out of qualitative research
5784,2021-07-17T07:30:34.618000+00:00,It also helps to do qualitative before quantitative
5785,2021-07-16T18:09:08.841000+00:00,Might be a good way to get more detailed qualitative stuff
5786,2021-07-16T18:08:53.581000+00:00,whether you collect an email at the end or something else
5787,2021-07-16T18:08:40.586000+00:00,Might be nice to open it up to talk/interview some people that use it too
5788,2021-07-16T18:08:26.545000+00:00,Thank you so much for the feedback! I really appreciate it. This was my first time creating a survey so I will keep everything in mind for editing this survey and future surveys!
5789,2021-07-16T18:07:19.996000+00:00,yea look up 'double barrel questions' for an example of things to avoid
5790,2021-07-16T18:06:50.223000+00:00,"Ah, gotcha!"
5791,2021-07-16T18:06:38.145000+00:00,I am specifically looking for those who have used the GroupWatch feature!
5792,2021-07-16T18:06:24.452000+00:00,"""what's your favourite part"" or ""what do you like most"""
5793,2021-07-16T18:06:15.186000+00:00,and it might be nice to split the good/bad question number 5 across two
5794,2021-07-16T18:06:08.344000+00:00,"it looks like you're using this to make it easier to collect qualitative data (i.e. all the open ends) but if you really want to quantify the need you should also probably include demographic questions (are there differences by audience type?), questions about their relationship with the service (how long have they been a sub, do they intend to renew, satisfaction, etc.), measure things like usage and satisfaction with the specific feature you're looking at, etc."
5795,2021-07-16T18:05:59.377000+00:00,Question 4 (what has been your experience) feels quite vague
5796,2021-07-16T18:05:20.489000+00:00,Is the survey going out to disney+ users or people that have already used groupwatch?
5797,2021-07-16T18:03:31.492000+00:00,<@!805849189116149760> thank you! You are absolutely right. Often or not often is too vague for data purposes.
5798,2021-07-16T18:01:27.516000+00:00,"don't have time to go through the whole thing, but just took a quick look and you probably should quantify behaviors instead of using vague attributes like 'often' that can mean different things to different people"
5799,2021-07-16T17:58:18.267000+00:00,"Thank you for the guidance! 
Here is more information on this project:
I am trying to redesign Disney+'s GroupWatch feature. I discovered that users must create a new GroupWatch room once they have finished their desired movie or TV Show they had selected when they first started. I want to find out if users are facing the same pain points as I am.

For more clarity, the steps the user must do are the following: Select TV Show/Movie, click GroupWatch, Invite Friend, click ""Watch Stream"". If the party wants to continue to the next episode or watch another movie, they must leave the Party and redo all the steps. I want to see if users are frustrated with this."
5800,2021-07-16T17:53:57.592000+00:00,üòâ might also help giving a bit of background info as to what your goal is and what you hope to learn
5801,2021-07-16T17:52:47.659000+00:00,"Hello everyone! I am looking for feedback on the questions I asked in my survey. I am not looking for participants. I am trying to make sure my survey is not leading or bias. I would greatly appreciate it if I could get feedback on my survey questions!

5802,2021-07-16T09:02:50.902000+00:00,"Okie lmao. I'll read these messages later... Right now, I need to finish and submit this assignment so that I can go ahead in my course"
5803,2021-07-16T09:02:46.257000+00:00,"Aslong you practice and are creating something that feels good, you're always doing well!"
5804,2021-07-16T09:02:26.139000+00:00,So design what you enjoy!
5805,2021-07-16T09:02:09.800000+00:00,"Specifically solving ""Wicked Problems"""
5806,2021-07-16T09:01:33.099000+00:00,"The core design process as a method of problem solving will be the same in any field, the context is just highly different"
5807,2021-07-16T09:01:03.856000+00:00,"Just as an app can be designed, you can design governmental laws"
5808,2021-07-16T09:00:47.189000+00:00,Design Thinking is common here
5809,2021-07-16T09:00:41.480000+00:00,"Yeah, best tip is to practice design as design"
5810,2021-07-16T09:00:34.941000+00:00,I still enjoyed it üòÉ
5811,2021-07-16T09:00:18.041000+00:00,"Actually, I am not sure about my exact career path. I just know that it's something that has to do with designing and programming"
5812,2021-07-16T08:59:54.832000+00:00,Like usually
5813,2021-07-16T08:59:51.576000+00:00,So I might be getting way too far out of topic
5814,2021-07-16T08:58:45.549000+00:00,
5815,2021-07-16T08:58:10.399000+00:00,
5816,2021-07-16T08:58:08.277000+00:00,Like if you go very deep into that you have stuff like
5817,2021-07-16T08:57:20.728000+00:00,"But do if you want to become Service Designer, or maybe a little bit of CX, but that's an assumption"
5818,2021-07-16T08:56:46.982000+00:00,Which isn't something you have to know to become a UX designer though
5819,2021-07-16T08:56:29.584000+00:00,üòÆ
5820,2021-07-16T08:56:05.040000+00:00,"That's why it's common in service design, you're not designing a mobile app with some UI, you're designing a ecosystem of a service."
5821,2021-07-16T08:54:53.209000+00:00,"Because in that sense not just the product is important, but the political context, state of living and all kind of highly unpredictable situations that you can't simply express in some data transcript"
5822,2021-07-16T08:52:48.698000+00:00,"Maybe Facebook got teams doing that, but if they do, most likely they're using scandinavian methods"
5823,2021-07-16T08:52:22.271000+00:00,"So the research is not on the social cultural context of the user, just the appeared behaviour"
5824,2021-07-16T08:51:58.200000+00:00,"Most UI is designed with the mindset of stimulus from the senses, kind of the HCI approach"
5825,2021-07-16T08:51:19.087000+00:00,"Which is very effective in some situations, and very ineffective in other situations."
5826,2021-07-16T08:50:41.216000+00:00,Oh
5827,2021-07-16T08:50:30.576000+00:00,It's not that they can't it's more about the mindset / process of doing this
5828,2021-07-16T08:49:59.825000+00:00,"For those who don't have proper internet access, they made ""lite"" apps which use less internet"
5829,2021-07-16T08:49:40.503000+00:00,"Actually, in places like Facebook, they can research the common user mentality of people from different regions and implement features accordingly ü§î"
5830,2021-07-16T08:49:17.347000+00:00,"But more like, what if you design for some village that's secluded from most people with no internet access?"
5831,2021-07-16T08:48:48.835000+00:00,"Yeah, it's not very useful for products like facebook I suppose, because that's more dedicated to the masses"
5832,2021-07-16T08:48:31.953000+00:00,This was said in the course. The product won't be much successful if the designer is too far or can't empathize with the user
5833,2021-07-16T08:47:52.432000+00:00,"Yea, I understand this point"
5834,2021-07-16T08:47:37.731000+00:00,It's very common when designing products for developing countries for example. Because most designers just are too far away from the problem to really objectively research it
5835,2021-07-16T08:46:36.380000+00:00,Other words that mean the same are: Co-design and Participatory design
5836,2021-07-16T08:46:01.583000+00:00,It's the mindset that your user can be an active creator in the design process
5837,2021-07-16T08:44:56.919000+00:00,"So it';s not very common there, by culture"
5838,2021-07-16T08:44:46.876000+00:00,Actually the US thought this was too socialistic
5839,2021-07-16T08:44:23.228000+00:00,Ah...
5840,2021-07-16T08:44:18.456000+00:00,It's a mindset where to user is your partner
5841,2021-07-16T08:44:11.288000+00:00,"Oh... So, they named the idea as ""Scandinavian"" style?"
5842,2021-07-16T08:44:01.494000+00:00,https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228872045_Scandinavian_Approaches_to_Participatory_Design
5843,2021-07-16T08:43:43.900000+00:00,"(Like Sweden, where IKEA came from)"
5844,2021-07-16T08:43:38.617000+00:00,It was invited in Scandinavia
5845,2021-07-16T08:43:32.574000+00:00,"(That's what I was about to ask. Yeah, it refers to the countries up in northern europe)"
5846,2021-07-16T08:43:22.673000+00:00,Service Design oriented often
5847,2021-07-16T08:43:15.933000+00:00,Isn't that some country or city?
5848,2021-07-16T08:43:07.816000+00:00,"What's ""Scandinavian""?"
5849,2021-07-16T08:42:24.504000+00:00,
5850,2021-07-16T08:41:31.884000+00:00,I understand things better now üòÉ
5851,2021-07-16T08:40:42.343000+00:00,Okie
5852,2021-07-16T08:40:14.766000+00:00,"A matrix graph with an X and Y, Y being amount of research, X being amount of user influence"
5853,2021-07-16T08:39:49.074000+00:00,Simply said it's a decision mindset
5854,2021-07-16T08:39:17.418000+00:00,Hmm ü§î
5855,2021-07-16T08:38:44.115000+00:00,Facebook would be Expert Led
5856,2021-07-16T08:38:35.364000+00:00,"Yea, but that's basically to demonstrate user creativity first and focus on recruiter second"
5857,2021-07-16T08:38:33.827000+00:00,"But if it's just something personal, or an expression as artist (like disney) it's designers LED"
5858,2021-07-16T08:38:13.497000+00:00,It's an instrument for getting hire
5859,2021-07-16T08:38:03.401000+00:00,"Depends depends, designing a good portfolio your user will still be the recruiter"
5860,2021-07-16T08:37:25.581000+00:00,"So, basically things like portfolio designing is designers led whereas things like support apps or consumer apps are research led... Right?"
5861,2021-07-16T08:36:41.598000+00:00,"Yea, that part's obvious üòÖ"
5862,2021-07-16T08:36:14.236000+00:00,I am from the Netherlands
5863,2021-07-16T08:36:09.716000+00:00,"Yes, flag of NL"
5864,2021-07-16T08:36:02.559000+00:00,Ah...
5865,2021-07-16T08:35:54.297000+00:00,"The design is based on someones idea, creativity, research came later"
5866,2021-07-16T08:35:31.715000+00:00,"Architecture is common for this, or theme parks such as disney"
5867,2021-07-16T08:35:16.290000+00:00,"There is also a concept called ""Designers LED"""
5868,2021-07-16T08:34:56.651000+00:00,"Do you have a flag of NL in your name of some emoji that says ""NL""?
Because I was able to see the flag on my phone, but I can only see ""NL"" on pc ü§î"
5869,2021-07-16T08:34:56.275000+00:00,"Plus, research by design is a mindset"
5870,2021-07-16T08:33:55.347000+00:00,Oh
5871,2021-07-16T08:33:26.821000+00:00,https://www.nngroup.com/
5872,2021-07-16T08:33:25.918000+00:00,NNgroup is a common research organisation
5873,2021-07-16T08:33:06.051000+00:00,"But of course, there are many others doing research!"
5874,2021-07-16T08:32:58.080000+00:00,"So any ideation, solving design challenges, is always in someway a translation of research"
5875,2021-07-16T08:32:34.755000+00:00,"Yeah, doesn't have to be something you want to do or like. I guess the main issue is that research is like the compass of design."
5876,2021-07-16T08:26:33.048000+00:00,"The other things still seem fine like brainstorming ideas, solving challenges, or designing prototypes... But, research just doesn't seem like something I would like to do"
5877,2021-07-16T08:25:11.948000+00:00,"Yea, I don't think I will take UX research later on... I'm not really a people person"
5878,2021-07-16T07:57:24.892000+00:00,"Making personas is not easy, so don't worry"
5879,2021-07-16T07:57:17.686000+00:00,No problem!
5880,2021-07-16T07:57:09.577000+00:00,Got it. Thanks for explaining!
5881,2021-07-16T07:57:03.068000+00:00,Oh
5882,2021-07-16T07:56:40.113000+00:00,WHile a different solution may have been much more valuable
5883,2021-07-16T07:56:08.495000+00:00,So then the designer would probably decrease time for this person
5884,2021-07-16T07:54:41.904000+00:00,"I guess the main problem with ""Wanting more time"" as a goal, is that it's a assumption of the solution by the person to reach their 'goal'"
5885,2021-07-16T07:54:17.636000+00:00,Oh
5886,2021-07-16T07:54:07.711000+00:00,"""Having more time"" can be a goal but ""Studying"" is also a goal"
5887,2021-07-16T07:53:14.245000+00:00,You don't use adjectives in goals
5888,2021-07-16T07:53:05.926000+00:00,Yeah it's not a very good example either
5889,2021-07-16T07:29:31.752000+00:00,"These are more the type of things you can design for, you can think features based on that information. And I suppose the main thing you want of a persona, is that it's translatable to a decision you will eventually make in choosing the right concept over another"
5890,2021-07-16T07:28:25.814000+00:00,"Because getting validation of other people that I did very well, makes me happy"
5891,2021-07-16T07:27:36.460000+00:00,Then the goal becomes (at least the social goal): impressing people with my fitness
5892,2021-07-16T07:26:38.366000+00:00,While for another person the need to show achievement is very strong
5893,2021-07-16T07:26:22.657000+00:00,"Take the bicycling app Strava for example. One person would say ""All this need to post how 'good' you are, how far you went, how fast you went is nonsense!"""
5894,2021-07-16T07:24:40.978000+00:00,But maybe it will be good practice!
5895,2021-07-16T07:24:29.928000+00:00,"What helps is trying to ask why 5 times for each element of your persona. This isn't actually usable though, since this data will then just be your own assumptions. But generally you want to do this with real people."
5896,2021-07-16T07:23:22.288000+00:00,"But what makes one person happy, isn't what makes another happy. Happy life is the result, not the goal in that sense"
5897,2021-07-16T07:22:37.813000+00:00,I guess everyone wants a 'happy life'
5898,2021-07-16T07:21:53.644000+00:00,"Usually you want to talk to real people I suppose, making personas up yourself isn't very valuable"
5899,2021-07-16T07:21:10.313000+00:00,"But, I guess I can't use same goals for different scenarios ü§î"
5900,2021-07-16T07:20:22.403000+00:00,This was the example I used
5901,2021-07-16T07:20:09.975000+00:00,"The challenge of a persona is mapping the core goal, frustration or motivation behind a persons behaviour. Which is difficult, because often people don't really know very well what drives them, which is why UXR is such a deep field!"
5902,2021-07-16T07:18:41.212000+00:00,"Well, appealing work = happy life?"
5903,2021-07-16T07:18:21.426000+00:00,Oh
5904,2021-07-16T07:18:05.785000+00:00,"What I'm getting at, is that wants are not goals, they are means to goals. Becoming a UX designer is an instrument of reaching some kind of different thing. The challenge of UXR is to see what is driving the deeper sense of the goal."
5905,2021-07-16T07:17:52.635000+00:00,"Lots of factory workers doing the dullest work ever, how come you don't want that?"
5906,2021-07-16T07:17:35.540000+00:00,Why is it important your work isn't dull?
5907,2021-07-16T07:16:50.618000+00:00,"I like designing and focusing on the user... But, I also like programming. But, after 2 years of backend development, it feels too dull to me. Frontend seems more appealing"
5908,2021-07-16T07:15:48.126000+00:00,"Front-end is largely dependent on designing. So, I thought to do that too."
5909,2021-07-16T07:14:37.999000+00:00,Why do you want that? What do you hope to gain by specialising in both design and front-end?
5910,2021-07-16T07:14:02.448000+00:00,If that makes sense ü§î
5911,2021-07-16T07:13:40.687000+00:00,I already am a Full stack developer... I'm planning to specialize in designing and front-end...
5912,2021-07-16T07:13:13.572000+00:00,"Why UX, why not something else?"
5913,2021-07-16T07:13:03.915000+00:00,"Uh, Kind of..."
5914,2021-07-16T07:12:35.304000+00:00,Do you want to become a UX designer?
5915,2021-07-16T07:12:22.043000+00:00,"The person is studying in college... So, won't her goal be to become a UX designer?"
5916,2021-07-16T07:11:44.659000+00:00,"But then, why does she want to become a UX designer? What's her goal of becoming a UX designer"
5917,2021-07-16T07:11:30.428000+00:00,"Nope, because that would still set the focus on time. ""Become a UX designer"" conveys the same informaiton"
5918,2021-07-16T07:10:22.721000+00:00,"Oh... So, would ""Time to focus on her studies to become a UX designer."" be a better goal?"
5919,2021-07-16T07:09:44.270000+00:00,"As in, the goals shouldn't be the means to an end, it should be the end!"
5920,2021-07-16T07:09:36.174000+00:00,"Uh... I don't know... The exemplar had a student example... So, I picked up that one goal from there. I couldn't think of anything else"
5921,2021-07-16T07:08:09.672000+00:00,"First on the concept of goals:

""Time to focus on her studies"", what is the goal here? Is it to have time to study, or to study? And if it's to study, is studying a goal in itself, or is she hoping to gain something by studying?"
5922,2021-07-16T07:04:47.795000+00:00,This is my first UX project
5923,2021-07-16T07:04:08.445000+00:00,"The names and images are randomly taken from ""Content Reel"" by Microsoft"

5925,2021-07-16T07:03:00.477000+00:00,Ah...
5926,2021-07-16T07:02:46.420000+00:00,Could try
5927,2021-07-16T07:02:32.264000+00:00,"Also a big difference between user and costumer journeys is that one you go out the scope of the person contact with the company. As in, an average day, rather than a map of touchpoints created by the company"
5928,2021-07-16T07:01:13.496000+00:00,"Uh, could you review the 2 personas I created for my first assignment?"
5929,2021-07-16T07:01:10.773000+00:00,Is just a possible example
5930,2021-07-16T07:00:57.313000+00:00,First trigger about wanting food > Action to start looking for food > Deciding on the type of food > Buying the food > Consuming the food > After food has been eaten
5931,2021-07-16T07:00:33.535000+00:00,Got it
5932,2021-07-16T07:00:25.834000+00:00,Anytime the consumer comes in contact with something from the company
5933,2021-07-16T07:00:07.347000+00:00,Basically you want to map touch points
5934,2021-07-16T06:58:33.084000+00:00,I think I can come up with 5 actions for that one
5935,2021-07-16T06:58:23.491000+00:00,"Okie, then I guess I'll use a different persona ü§î"
5936,2021-07-16T06:57:52.039000+00:00,But imagine a sandwhich
5937,2021-07-16T06:57:40.075000+00:00,"Yeah, there's no hard rule"
5938,2021-07-16T06:57:29.686000+00:00,"It's almost the same. The idea behind it is that one you analyse a ""using"" concept, while the other goes more in depth about mapping a ""buying"" process. Since buying is different from using, often they have different steps in the process."
5939,2021-07-16T06:56:20.137000+00:00,Will it still be a user journey map with 4 actions instead of 5?
5940,2021-07-16T06:55:53.849000+00:00,"But yes, for buying something 5 is actually not a strange thing"
5941,2021-07-16T06:55:44.981000+00:00,"I don't remember anything about ""Customer journey map""... I don't think I have heard it before"
5942,2021-07-16T06:55:03.275000+00:00,Oh
5943,2021-07-16T06:54:55.496000+00:00,"Ahh, then it's probably a costumer journey, they look like user journeys but they're different"
5944,2021-07-16T06:54:24.249000+00:00,"My topic is to design a customer loyalty app for a sandwich shop in new jersey... Now, the first 2 actions are not really relevant..."
5945,2021-07-16T06:54:03.441000+00:00,5 can be enough sometimes. It just really depends on what kind of journey you're mapping and what you're hoping to gain from it
5946,2021-07-16T06:53:37.295000+00:00,Depends on the case Riday!
5947,2021-07-16T06:53:18.231000+00:00,"Is in, showing the sequence of actions that lead a person to display a certain behaviour"
5948,2021-07-16T06:53:15.248000+00:00,"My course has this template with 5 actions... But, they haven't specified how many are needed. Now, I can't figure out 5 actions for my assignment project."
5949,2021-07-16T06:52:49.920000+00:00,
5950,2021-07-16T06:52:47.233000+00:00,Like laddering would do it this way
5951,2021-07-16T06:52:22.433000+00:00,How many actions are required in a user journey map?
5952,2021-07-16T06:52:11.870000+00:00,It's supposed to show of which value leads to witch decision
5953,2021-07-16T06:51:42.603000+00:00,I think it's closer to laddering analysis
5954,2021-07-16T06:51:33.777000+00:00,"Mhhh not sure if AEIOU would do the same thing, since that doesn't explain a sequence, it just clusters things based on category"
5955,2021-07-15T23:35:11.774000+00:00,The only thing I can think off that‚Äôs close is that Pyramid of needs
5956,2021-07-15T22:54:20.025000+00:00,I think it is supposed to be used for teaching about the hierarchy. It provides two different ways how the levels of hierarchy map to different things such as goals.
5957,2021-07-15T21:50:25.410000+00:00,Feels like doing thr AEIOU method would‚Äôve covered it
5958,2021-07-15T21:50:14.502000+00:00,I don‚Äôt get what it‚Äôs getting. At
5959,2021-07-15T21:49:02.018000+00:00,"if anything it's a research tool not a final deliverable, but yeah, even as a research tool it seems a little questionable"
5960,2021-07-15T21:03:49.344000+00:00,your goal at work is to be a simplifier and that looks like more effort than the value i would get from solving it
5961,2021-07-15T21:02:26.577000+00:00,if someone handed that to me i would probably say thanks but not look at it
5962,2021-07-15T18:28:03.938000+00:00,"Oof, filling that out comprehensively seems like a chore"
5963,2021-07-15T09:45:31.617000+00:00,
5964,2021-07-15T09:45:28.952000+00:00,Anyone ever tried using these kind of graphs for analysing JTBD thingies?
5965,2021-07-14T21:01:55.638000+00:00,The switch turned out less relevant than expected it seems

5969,2021-07-14T05:22:48.901000+00:00,Its actually Amazon.in blocking me from adding any of my cards ü§î probably will take it up with Amazon tomorrow and see where I get lol. Thanks for the thoughts Kenny :)
5970,2021-07-14T00:13:36.154000+00:00,They should be able to process it for you
5971,2021-07-14T00:13:28.663000+00:00,So if you call the number at the back of your card and just confirm you want to do the transaction
5972,2021-07-14T00:10:13.927000+00:00,I used to work in that area
5973,2021-07-14T00:10:07.166000+00:00,The block they put is an auto block rule on the credit card for fraud detection
5974,2021-07-14T00:09:49.599000+00:00,To allow the amazon.in purchase
5975,2021-07-14T00:09:43.445000+00:00,You might have to call your bank tbh
5976,2021-07-14T00:09:37.214000+00:00,Weird
5977,2021-07-13T23:59:14.375000+00:00,Might be a specific issue with Amazon.in ? Not sure tbh
5978,2021-07-13T23:58:30+00:00,I know some gift cards and etc do do that
5979,2021-07-13T23:58:17.753000+00:00,I wonder if like idk they do it to India because there‚Äôs a lot of card scams that happen
5980,2021-07-13T23:57:54.417000+00:00,What in the world
5981,2021-07-13T23:57:46.068000+00:00,Oh :/
5982,2021-07-13T23:57:38.484000+00:00,Participant is saying that they cannot redeem the USA/Amazon.com card to their account ü§î
5983,2021-07-13T23:35:13.395000+00:00,I bought it on amazon.ca and sent it to a friend in the states
5984,2021-07-13T23:34:49.087000+00:00,if u buy the USA and redeem it elsewhere it works
5985,2021-07-13T23:16:20.665000+00:00,"Anyone have experience sending (electronic) Amazon gift cards internationally for participant compensation/incentive? Trying to go through Amazon.in for a participant in India, but it won't accept my bank cards üôÉ"

5989,2021-07-13T21:19:01.968000+00:00,Hi guys. I want to send out a survey questionnaire to research for my capstone project. I tried posting the form to discord group but so far have not received any replies. Do you have any particular group or place where you can get your survey filled out by multiple people?
5990,2021-07-13T16:48:19.440000+00:00,"I imagine using something like miro, to let them document their own timeline could help maybe..."
5991,2021-07-13T16:46:28.018000+00:00,Have you ever done such an interview before?
5992,2021-07-13T16:46:18.303000+00:00,"Ah yes, that definitely makes sense!"
5993,2021-07-13T16:44:17.429000+00:00,They thought they had a solution but then realized never mind they needed to try something different
5994,2021-07-13T16:44:01.352000+00:00,It‚Äôs a timeline
5995,2021-07-13T16:42:56.123000+00:00,Why
5996,2021-07-13T16:42:55.052000+00:00,But mostly they changed their solution completely
5997,2021-07-13T16:42:49.315000+00:00,Maybe
5998,2021-07-13T16:42:05.266000+00:00,"As in, they deleted it from their cart?"
5999,2021-07-13T16:42:04.343000+00:00,It was in that first link u sent
6000,2021-07-13T16:41:19.470000+00:00,They switched from Apple to Samsung
6001,2021-07-13T16:41:11.349000+00:00,The product like
6002,2021-07-13T16:40:19.901000+00:00,"Or switched as in, they send a product back to buy a new one?"
6003,2021-07-13T16:39:47.053000+00:00,"Switched the product itself, like taking a red ipad instead of a blue?"
6004,2021-07-13T16:39:21.627000+00:00,Looks like I need to do that and uncover some specific JTBD with that
6005,2021-07-13T16:38:29.509000+00:00,literally sales funnel except the person recently switched
6006,2021-07-13T16:38:15.629000+00:00,oh so as I read more it sounds just a narrow niche

You may have better luck at something like: https://www.reddit.com/r/SampleSize/ people on this discord aren't here for filling out surveys."
6014,2021-07-12T14:04:58.103000+00:00,"You guys only try find mistakes of other people and try to push content from one room to the other but don‚Äôt try to help others.

6018,2021-07-09T20:49:54.574000+00:00,I got it from a free book store!

6025,2021-07-08T15:03:12.833000+00:00,Miro should be able to do guest access for editing with no need for invite or account - not sure what permissions need to be set to do it though. Diagrams.net seems like fun though!
6026,2021-07-08T14:04:58.799000+00:00,I got a free premium accüëÄ
6027,2021-07-08T14:04:46.705000+00:00,No worries

6032,2021-07-08T13:59:59.979000+00:00,it worked and I can move stuff not sure about add
6033,2021-07-08T13:47:06.479000+00:00,recruiting ppl out of their busy schedules is hard enough lol
6034,2021-07-08T13:46:42.278000+00:00,that's exactly it üòÖ or make them have to sign up for an account

6040,2021-07-08T13:08:56.289000+00:00,because they might only want them to have access to it once
6041,2021-07-08T13:08:45.299000+00:00,I guess for <@!520713455389376523> they probably didnt want to have to add these ppl and then removing after

6054,2021-07-08T12:57:11.079000+00:00,this is why they didnt

6057,2021-07-08T00:44:57.873000+00:00,super useful for so much lol
6058,2021-07-08T00:44:48.210000+00:00,i also use diagrams.net for user flows!

6066,2021-07-07T18:38:45.897000+00:00,the account and # of cards were my main barrier and i think this solves it
6067,2021-07-07T18:38:20.786000+00:00,this could work

6074,2021-07-07T18:36:05.134000+00:00,users need a figma account to edit figma files though right?
6075,2021-07-07T18:34:38.608000+00:00,worst case figma it
6076,2021-07-07T18:31:17.294000+00:00,although 45 cards could be a bit much for cardsorting lmao
6077,2021-07-07T18:31:00.322000+00:00,i've got 45 cards in two studies
6078,2021-07-07T18:30:53.181000+00:00,ah dang i can only run one study with 20 cards max

6080,2021-07-07T18:16:20.953000+00:00,so no money :(
6081,2021-07-07T18:16:13.654000+00:00,does anyone know any good free platforms for cardsorting? it turns out you need a paid plan to let guests edit on miro and i'm not sure what other platforms i can use. i'm running two cardsorts for a school design team
6082,2021-07-06T16:53:28.368000+00:00,Maybe have them target senior folks who can make their teams participate üòÑ
6083,2021-07-06T16:50:56.094000+00:00,but tbh I think the recruiter approach that Aaron mentioned is better
6084,2021-07-06T16:43:46.949000+00:00,to see if a entire design team or team of some short would be willing to hop on for the project
6085,2021-07-06T16:43:29.273000+00:00,one outside of the box approach (for some reason) I can think of is posting it as a problem statement?

6088,2021-07-06T16:17:51.989000+00:00,"External - TL;DR - recruiting small, interdisciplinary teams replicates recruiting for astronauts for our purposes (aiming to evaluate usage of the prototype in a specific scenario that requires a team and communication using the prototype). As long as they are interdisciplinary, a small team, and have worked together before (the longer the better). Compromises on the participant criteria are okay, though the team aspect is the one part we haven't evaluated or been able to recruit for yet."
6089,2021-07-06T15:27:38.967000+00:00,Have you tried any B2B specialist recruiters? Probably expensive though.

6100,2021-07-06T07:06:38.136000+00:00,"But that's a bit of a quick and dirty version, they're at most going to stay for 15 mins"
6101,2021-07-06T07:06:20.401000+00:00,"I've only done so before face to face, by walking up to groups of people in public, then let them prototype it together."
6102,2021-07-06T02:49:35.047000+00:00,"Anyone have particular experience in recruiting teams of participants? Looking for tips or ways to approach it. Specifically looking for teams of 3-7 people for some simulations to evaluate a prototype in context - aiming for people who've worked together for some amount of time, ideally years at a time with differing backgrounds, educations, and experiences. One aspect we've tried so far is trying to get buy-in from one person, and then have them try to recruit/convince their team to sign up and join - but this assumes some form of connection already or that this one person is willing to talk with us. Posting to social media/broadcasting the study works fine for getting individuals, but not sure about getting groups/teams this way üò¨"
6103,2021-07-04T20:56:19.005000+00:00,"A random tidbit that I used at least for in-person sessions (pre-covid) - Give the compensation/incentive up-front after consent. Their participation is voluntary, and really the compensation is thanking them for their time/showing, not necessarily their data (though I'd definitely pay for better/more complete data if I could). No worries in my short experience about participants taking the comp and running/not going through the session (and same from another UXR who's done this for some years now), though YMMV. 

Only time I've not compensated a participant that has shown up is when it was clear they were trying to scam the system to get compensation for no effort (using multiple accounts to go through the screener, for example)."
6104,2021-07-03T00:24:09.855000+00:00,"Speaking from the pov of someone at a research firm, not an in-house ux research team (they may have different needs & processes): seems like you could combine them if the same respondent is a potential customer for both use cases you're interested in, but not if collab/group buyers and/or seat-reservers are very different types of consumers that don't have much overlap. the other consideration, as others have said, is how much you need to cover for each objective - if it's a lot, then it's better to address it via separate studies to be able to fully answer your research questions.

re: video - your screening and recruiting process should have already covered stuff like how the study will be conducted and consent, it shouldn't be a surprise to them at that point. a brief note about how video recordings will and won't be used is always good form at the beginning of an interview. 

if someone leaves midway through with a good reason then you should still compensate them and use whatever you got if it's useful. if they leave for a weird reason or if they are strange/disruptive, then you probably want to weigh that in deciding whether the data is valid. probably still compensate them fully regardless... making a potentially unstable person upset at you and your business is a safety liability that is not worth the trivial cost savings. if you're doing the research at a third party facility that manages the recruit then you can just let them handle it since you're more insulated."
6105,2021-07-02T23:38:48.876000+00:00,Depending on the pain points allowing bulk buy or etc is a corresponding feature imo. But in order to determine bulk buy of course you can dive deeper again into the topic if you don‚Äôt understand what that means to the user
6106,2021-07-02T23:38:23.926000+00:00,Those would all be part of a study of how someone ‚Äúbuys coffee‚Äù
6107,2021-07-02T23:38:10.861000+00:00,It doesn‚Äôt matter if they rather buy in bulk or they want to sit down and reserved
6108,2021-07-02T23:37:57.596000+00:00,If the topic is how someone buys coffee
6109,2021-07-02T23:37:44.043000+00:00,Regarding your specific question about the two goals it‚Äôs hard to answer imho because you have narrowed it down too far almost as user stories/ features vs topics
6110,2021-07-02T23:36:36.544000+00:00,It‚Äôs always an ‚Äúit depends‚Äù
6111,2021-07-02T23:36:27.061000+00:00,The compensation is idk it‚Äôs tough usually the compensation is for the entire thing but if the participants stressed emotionally and that‚Äôs why they stopped I may personally bend the rules and still thank them for their time with something representative
6112,2021-07-02T23:35:19.298000+00:00,"If at any time a participant decides to stop you can use what they have given Thus far unless you deep thay somehow by not completing the research, it fails your participant selection criteria"
6113,2021-07-02T22:05:13.548000+00:00,For gifts no idea. I've never given participants gifts. Just cookies and coffee. Might be very cultural.
6114,2021-07-02T21:59:45.826000+00:00,"For goals; it's better to focus on one primary goal. Because if you focus one two you're almost doing two projects at once, also having two research questions, kind of cutting your time in half... Though, you could research to see which of these goals is best worth pursuing. But pick one, for the sake of defining the scope more clearly. 

For recording: if people don't want to be recorded then you just take notes. Works especially well if one person conducts the interview and another takes notes. One common framework that's easy for taking notes is; AEIOU: https://help.ethnohub.com/guide/aeiou-framework

If they some how leave during the research you just take whatever data you can and see which data you miss. What the users/people did is not of importance of stakeholders (if they walked away or did not want to be recorded), only the data and what you're going to do with it"
6115,2021-07-02T21:44:18.340000+00:00,"Umn dat is very interesting question, well physical researching is will be harder than survey."
6116,2021-07-02T21:30:02.138000+00:00,"I was also thinking about these other issues related to conducting usability tests and research: What do you do if a participant does not consent to being video recorded during the study? Do you continue with the study (without recording it) or do you basically thank them for their time and immediately send them home? What do you do if partway through a usability study, a participant decides they no longer want to continue for some reason? Do you scrap the data you've collected thus far? Do you still include the data up to that point, since you had the participant's consent for those portions of the study? Do you still give the participant an incentive/gift if they only completed a portion of the study? How do you talk about this during the presentation of your research results with stakeholders?"
6117,2021-07-02T21:28:46.585000+00:00,"Hey there, I'm new to UX research. For context, I'm in week 1 of the ""Conduct UX Research and Test Early Concepts"" course in Google's UX Design program. I'm having some questions as I go through this. Is it okay to study two different goals/objectives within the same study? W‚Äãhile doing example activities with a fake coffee shop's app in the other portions of the course, we've been thinking about two goals: we're trying to help users place group/collaborative orders for pick-up (like an intern persona who needs to place one big group order for her bosses and then pick it up all at once) and we're trying to help users who want to reserve a seat and dine-in (like a student persona who needs a comfy place to do their remote work uninterrupted all day and get coffee delivered to them so they don't lose their seat). Is this okay to tackle in one study, or should I conduct two separate studies for these goals? The exemplars we're given only ever seem to focus on placing group orders for quick pick-up, but maybe that's because the instructors want me to think up the rest. Based on the research goals/objectives I write, I then need to come up with research questions that my research is trying to answer. I then need to list some of the key performance indicators I'll use to measure my progress toward these research goals‚Äîbut I'm worried that maybe I'm juggling too much by trying to study the group pick-up orders and the seat reservation with tableside delivery."

6119,2021-06-30T16:57:00.664000+00:00,"I haven't used activity logging in my work specifically, though know its in the same line of methods as diary studies - sampling the users activity over a period of time (specifically asking them to log what they do each day or in specific periods of time throughout each day/week) - definitely different than usability testing in its goals- I think activity logging can be really useful in the generative phase (What do users do each day, and how does their usage of our tools/product fit into the rest of their day? Do they have specific activities that prompt usage, or things that typically come after?)."
6120,2021-06-30T09:06:43.387000+00:00,"Hey everyone. I've been studying some academic papers in the UX field and came up with a term called ""activity logging"" as a method of evaluating user experience. Is it the same as usability testing or are they separate tools?"
6121,2021-06-29T22:52:49.280000+00:00,"What were the issues found in the original design? Have there been reported issues on a users end somewhere that point out the problems, such as customer support tickets, reports on social media, or web analytics showing drop off at this point? Have you observed/tested users using the old design to see why it might be necessary to ""guide"" the user? There are probably tons of design patterns to rely on for submission forms or for designing guiding experiences, but an idea of what the user issue was with the original design would help direct your efforts. If you want to go without the research portions, definitely send over to <#697888699643592715> to get ideas for improving what you already have."

6124,2021-06-29T16:17:03.702000+00:00,"search a lot about this problem, I want to improve this form by guiding the user through the process. but found general solutions. I should make user testing. But what I can do before it. Should I make small interactions design to guide the user? will this affect user usability?"
6125,2021-06-26T07:21:17.426000+00:00,They are colleagues
6126,2021-06-26T07:21:10.596000+00:00,Especially since your users are no longer just users
6127,2021-06-26T07:21:00.958000+00:00,Definitely the most important thing if your UX research concerns back-office software
6128,2021-06-25T14:10:06.050000+00:00,This is something that I have heard a lot from different people. To make friends with someone from the different roles and departments (such as accounting) that you can talk about their job and how you impact them.
6129,2021-06-25T01:29:28.461000+00:00,"Just be open to talk to anyone and everyone, even from different departments. Your finding as a researcher is going impact everyone's job, so it is good to know how they play a role into what you do so you can make better decisions for your research."

6133,2021-06-22T20:04:15.433000+00:00,other things like make sure you have someone to moderate and also write down notes ideally not the same person
6134,2021-06-22T20:03:23.847000+00:00,that way its easier to tackle persona and organizational biases
6135,2021-06-22T20:03:10.126000+00:00,make sure you do some sort of exercise to just notice and define maybe what biases and assumptions you have
6136,2021-06-22T18:53:20.764000+00:00,Congrats to you!‚ú®  What I tell my assistant researcher is to always ask questions! Be curious and don't hesitate to ask why I am doing this in a certain way. (& don't think that that is the only way!) aaaaaand I personally appreciate an awesome note-taker üòã Make it a habit to jot down notes on paper/documents/where ever you're comfortable. That way we don't miss any great insights or just in general meeting notes and/or next steps!

6142,2021-06-17T18:54:58.869000+00:00,but user research for usability testing --> needs prototypes
6143,2021-06-17T18:54:44.342000+00:00,but i could. be wrong
6144,2021-06-17T18:54:40.660000+00:00,doesnt need to imo
6145,2021-06-17T18:54:33.520000+00:00,maybe they dont know why it matters and etc
6146,2021-06-17T18:54:22.574000+00:00,then it sounds like the incentive
6147,2021-06-17T18:53:53.464000+00:00,They mostly just view the message but not answer or click on the link
6148,2021-06-17T18:52:27.193000+00:00,Does a user research case study need prototypes or is that more if a ux case study thing

6157,2021-06-17T16:20:25.499000+00:00,I have just kinda read what was written at top but I guess I wanted add on and ask what is the biggest difference between a ux case study and a ux research case study ...the reason I ask is because I am interested in both and am generally curious
6158,2021-06-17T13:49:10.298000+00:00,this is what I meant by ... the process depends... theres no best flow or template for a case study

Does anyone knows how is this bias called: when you work for a lot of time on something, and start **not** noticing the obvious things? sometimes overlook obvious 'bad' things, just because you already got used to them

6171,2021-06-17T02:00:03.408000+00:00,Assumptions of some sort and identifying gaps
6172,2021-06-17T01:59:49.216000+00:00,2) secondary research or supporting facts
6173,2021-06-17T01:59:26.756000+00:00,1) problem space
6174,2021-06-17T01:59:17.336000+00:00,There isn‚Äôt really a template per say? But generally what I do is
6175,2021-06-17T01:48:36.831000+00:00,Guiding  external customers to do specific tasks they want step by step using a tool that displays steps and animations (this tool is kinda embedded to the system)
6176,2021-06-17T01:46:06.400000+00:00,"Oh okay, but what structure/ format to present a case study would you suggest???"
6177,2021-06-17T01:42:29.965000+00:00,What sort of resources and experiences have you had so far with UX? Just so I know what to give you
6178,2021-06-17T01:42:05.072000+00:00,First find the problem and make sure you work on defining and scoping your problem out well
6179,2021-06-17T01:41:30.793000+00:00,Have you done some research maybe in the area to learn what could be potential challenges for your user?
6180,2021-06-17T01:41:13.021000+00:00,What‚Äôs the problem space you‚Äôve narrowed down?

6183,2021-06-15T22:38:11.130000+00:00,Just a survey is generally not enough to capture feelings and etc
6184,2021-06-15T22:37:59.541000+00:00,Check out the different ux research methods and see which one is best suited and also if you need multiple eg first round survey then user interviews
6185,2021-06-15T22:25:35.414000+00:00,That‚Äôs much better. Thank you for such a detailed explanation.
6186,2021-06-15T22:04:01.667000+00:00,"Before interviewing, you'll want to decide on your problem statement before unless you are sending out quick surveys to get a temperature on what's currently happening. 

One you have your problem statement, this will focus you on specific issues you are solving. You'll find more problems you can solve along the way, but unless it goes conveniently with your problem statement, try not to get too distracted as that's how a team or person can feel lost in direction in a case study. 

1) problem statement
2) send out surveys (try to get at least 10 responses back and interview 5 of them for more qualitative research)
3) map out your findings with affinity mapping, empathy mapping, etc 
This will help cluster your research so you can see the big picture and know your users more. 

That's just an example of how one can start. Of course, you could also start by secondary research, do a teardown of an existing product and then redesign it. 

Even if your project is made up, it can still have a real and functional aspect to it. I like to focus on equitable designs for hypothetical projects. Like how would those who are disabled or groups who aren't considered in the design process would use this product. Good luck!"

I have been given a Hypothetical Project about an app for movie ticket booking. I dont know what kind of questions I should prepare for the user interview. I am also confused on where I can find some users to interview for this Hypothetical project.

Am I supposed to make things up? 
Am I supposed to hire users to interview them? 
What open ended Questions will allow me to know the users pain point?

Or am I supposed to do it in a completely different way?

6191,2021-06-11T05:37:41.617000+00:00,ahh i should solidify my goals first then
6192,2021-06-11T05:36:37.629000+00:00,I think it depends on what your goal for the research is! Are you looking to optimize the app or are you looking for a way to increase users?
6193,2021-06-11T05:35:53.828000+00:00,should i be testing on people who have had experience with using these apps or just anyone ü§î

After onboarding you can give them a few moments to see what their interaction are with the supporter/listener. & ask follow-up questions of what they thought about that.

6201,2021-06-10T19:16:45.926000+00:00,Jared Spool tweeted some real hard words about the SUS
6202,2021-06-10T19:15:55.174000+00:00,ahh thank you for the discussion and clarification!!
6203,2021-06-10T19:15:29.651000+00:00,"a participant may say your system is amazing, but never have completed a single task"
6204,2021-06-10T19:15:16.701000+00:00,"it isnt inherently tied to task success, or actual usability metrics like time-to-task"
6205,2021-06-10T19:15:01.626000+00:00,the SUS is just used to give you a relatively high level assessment of how usable someone may perceive your product to be.
6206,2021-06-10T19:13:42.437000+00:00,"""Look our SUS score went up from 50 to 75"""
6207,2021-06-10T19:13:36.458000+00:00,cannot be compared? then how would it be a benchmark that's used so often
6208,2021-06-10T19:13:34.150000+00:00,but a lot of stakeholders will TRY to use it to measure success
6209,2021-06-10T19:13:01.757000+00:00,and SUS scores cannot really be compared against each other
6210,2021-06-10T19:12:54.423000+00:00,It should never be used as the only datapoint
6211,2021-06-10T19:12:36.457000+00:00,There are a lot of issues with the system usability scale. Its a self-evaluated subjective measurement of usability.
6212,2021-06-10T19:10:24.897000+00:00,it was mainly around how it's not correctly used....like with a lot of our processes..
6213,2021-06-10T19:09:22.723000+00:00,Does anyone use the SUS Test for evaluation of usability or have a real life example they've done? I saw a recent video on Jakob saying it may not be the best.

6278,2021-06-01T17:18:14.728000+00:00,"A lot of conscious practice too. Something that helps is writing down the questions, so you see where you make the mistakes. Also record the interviews and see where you make them. Usually the simpler the question is the less bias can sneak in too!"
6279,2021-06-01T15:50:26.911000+00:00,by identifying what biases you have can already help remove them from the questions
6280,2021-06-01T15:50:09.306000+00:00,could conduct a biases workshop to lay out what they are
6281,2021-06-01T14:50:37.633000+00:00,"right now i'm running semi-structured interviews with other designers to figure out what issues they face in a specific space (can't say more than that), and I'm finding that my own biases, as a designer, are really sneaking in"
6282,2021-06-01T14:50:06.048000+00:00,"hi! i'm not sure if this is the correct place to ask, but does anyone here have their own techniques that they've found really works to help them avoid asking biased/leading questions during user interviews?"
6283,2021-05-31T20:22:02.683000+00:00,"Sweet thanks! I'll check these out. I'm intrigued by only testing with 5 users. It makes sense to do small tests and quickly iterate.

I'm finding the main issues people are having are with the platform itself as useberry is quite limiting. I made a prototype on protopie but couldn't find a suitable user testing tool that integrates well."
6284,2021-05-31T17:43:16.679000+00:00,"Hi I am not sure if this is the right place to ask this question. 
So I prepared a feature list for my project and now I was thinking if I can make a feature roadmap too. I‚Äôve gone through various case studies and found that it‚Äôs a team activity. 
I am working on case study for my portfolio so is it possible to make feature roadmap? 
If it is then can you help with how to do that based on Impact and cost/effort?"
6285,2021-05-31T17:39:05.617000+00:00,esp with usability testing
6286,2021-05-31T17:39:01.611000+00:00,you still reach data saturation really fast
6287,2021-05-31T14:56:35.236000+00:00,She's testing an onboarding prototype. Its very unlikely that quantitative data will provide any insight that qualitative would not. The second article addresses this.
6288,2021-05-31T14:51:46.670000+00:00,"This only counts for qualitative though, not quantitative testing"
6289,2021-05-31T14:27:21.866000+00:00,"These might help: <@!683212821189754980>

6290,2021-05-30T22:09:19.794000+00:00,Thanks! That's super helpful. I figured as much and started to notice the overlap with a smaller sample size.
6291,2021-05-30T22:06:55.655000+00:00,"and then in general, be careful with unmoderated usability tests."
6292,2021-05-30T22:06:23.349000+00:00,"Its totally fine to do just 1-2. You basically want to stop when you start seeing huge overlap in the usability issues. You go away, fix the issues and then run another round of usability tests."
6293,2021-05-30T22:05:25.498000+00:00,No more than 5 participants before you greatly start seeing diminishing returns.
6294,2021-05-30T21:11:25.633000+00:00,What is a good sample size for conducting usability tests? I put one together in useberry to test out an onboarding prototype. Got almost 200 responses and not sure if we need more than that since the feedback seems similar across the board.
6295,2021-05-30T17:24:36.849000+00:00,"Thanks <@!209640428151111680> . Most of the times I read about UX I do it on Smashing Magazine and NN/G website, but UX matters seems like another great place for knowledge!"
6296,2021-05-30T17:20:07.868000+00:00,Lots of stuff there

6298,2021-05-30T17:20:02.879000+00:00,No problem!
6299,2021-05-30T17:19:07.465000+00:00,"Thanks! I was having trouble only finding older texts about mobile usability, and due to the academic nature of the project I need to consider more recent articles, so this one will definitely help, it looks very comprehensive!"

6302,2021-05-30T17:00:30.204000+00:00,I guess you could search for stuff like hand autonomy and mobile usability!
6303,2021-05-30T16:59:36.426000+00:00,"But maybe there are a lot of papers on just mobile, I haven't seen them"
6304,2021-05-30T16:58:39.698000+00:00,"Alright, I'm unsure whether there's papers on device specific. Because interaction studies are often very medium wide. A lot on cognitive load theory etc."
6305,2021-05-30T15:22:20.303000+00:00,"User interviews showed a preference for mobile apps while achieving similar goals as this project. The main goal of this product will be to facilitate the search for matching housemates, and participants interviewed claimed to have used or wanted to use mobile apps to look for housemates, friendship or partners. Therefore I'm focusing on mobile first"
6306,2021-05-30T15:01:12.406000+00:00,Why specifically a mobile app?
6307,2021-05-29T16:18:17.411000+00:00,"Hi everyone! Not sure if this is the right chat to ask this, but... I'm on the research phase for the design of a mobile app as part of my master's final project, and I'd love to read more articles/books about mobile usability and app design. I'm currently reading Mobile First and im looking for my next lecture!"
6308,2021-05-26T15:08:11.524000+00:00,and see if u can find it
6309,2021-05-26T15:08:08.005000+00:00,like ask urself why again
6310,2021-05-26T15:08:03.551000+00:00,yeah!
6311,2021-05-26T14:41:01.018000+00:00,"As in, an extra layer for the causes. Causes of causes, to make a bit more context"
6312,2021-05-26T14:39:33.059000+00:00,"Yeah, I guess I need to try and be less vague with words. Maybe work a bit more down in the fishbones too"
6313,2021-05-26T14:35:51.110000+00:00,I personally understand what you mean now
6314,2021-05-26T14:35:25.014000+00:00,okok i see it now
6315,2021-05-26T14:35:22.415000+00:00,ah yes
6316,2021-05-26T14:21:36.866000+00:00,But then with the lines of course
6317,2021-05-26T14:19:57.885000+00:00,Results of qualitative coding > affinity clusters
6318,2021-05-26T14:19:25.419000+00:00,Yeah they're insights from interview data
6319,2021-05-26T14:19:11.912000+00:00,Like this for example
6320,2021-05-26T14:18:59.144000+00:00,
6321,2021-05-26T14:18:35.923000+00:00,cause right now I just see ideas essentially üôÇ
6322,2021-05-26T14:18:28.736000+00:00,"maybe if you could explain the stickies a bit on one of the ""arms"" I can understand a bit more"
6323,2021-05-26T14:17:57.573000+00:00,it just helps with someone else reading it
6324,2021-05-26T14:17:49.947000+00:00,yeahh
6325,2021-05-26T14:17:35.077000+00:00,By consistency you mean the way it's written down I assume?
6326,2021-05-26T14:16:18.045000+00:00,"""emotionally connect"""
6327,2021-05-26T14:16:08.365000+00:00,"""Easier to approach"""
6328,2021-05-26T14:15:57.494000+00:00,"eg ""Missing colleagues and friends"""
6329,2021-05-26T14:15:42.298000+00:00,or its the statements but I would try and keep it short and concise if possible on each statement (almost like just labels)
6330,2021-05-26T14:15:20.340000+00:00,"either all of them is ""I want to ...."""
6331,2021-05-26T14:14:55.622000+00:00,if you could make it more consistent maybe...?
6332,2021-05-26T14:14:45.812000+00:00,others are your interpretations
6333,2021-05-26T14:14:36.604000+00:00,"one of them is ""i want..."""
6334,2021-05-26T14:14:26.787000+00:00,I think its also just the consistency between the sticky notes
6335,2021-05-26T14:14:12.020000+00:00,"""connecting with people"""
6336,2021-05-26T14:14:05.041000+00:00,this tells me they are 3 ideas off of that branch of

6338,2021-05-26T14:13:47.859000+00:00,im assuming this is yours atm

6340,2021-05-26T14:13:17.207000+00:00,cause that part is actually important in showing the relationship
6341,2021-05-26T14:13:08.777000+00:00,or bones
6342,2021-05-26T14:13:06.232000+00:00,"but I would draw the ""lines"""
6343,2021-05-26T14:13:01.459000+00:00,they dont have to be they can be on the same level
6344,2021-05-26T14:12:46.226000+00:00,So the yellow stickies itself should be a cause and effect chain as well?
6345,2021-05-26T14:11:28.248000+00:00,essentially are the stickies on the same level
6346,2021-05-26T14:10:47.834000+00:00,what are their relationship besides being in the Green sticky bucket together
6347,2021-05-26T14:10:33.923000+00:00,close but im having trouble with the yellow stickies
6348,2021-05-26T14:08:05.817000+00:00,This is just a rough miro sketch though
6349,2021-05-26T14:07:49.083000+00:00,
6350,2021-05-26T14:07:39.433000+00:00,Would you do it something like this?
6351,2021-05-26T14:07:34.652000+00:00,<@!589247034410926088> I sort of attempted to fishbone
6352,2021-05-25T17:53:00.272000+00:00,resharing here cuz it's relevant to this channel https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jf0i2CIr81E
6353,2021-05-25T14:58:07.235000+00:00,yeah!
6354,2021-05-25T14:57:07.603000+00:00,"Yeah, without showing the data I mean! More as hypothesis basis"
6355,2021-05-25T14:56:48.298000+00:00,that could lead to affecting results I think
6356,2021-05-25T14:56:34.786000+00:00,only thing I caution is showing the data to them and asking why
6357,2021-05-25T14:56:19.245000+00:00,yeah thats a great idea
6358,2021-05-25T14:55:35.578000+00:00,"Anyway, thanks for the fishbone. I will use that one instead!"
6359,2021-05-25T14:53:13.988000+00:00,"Yeah, i sometimes used the reverse assumption method. You take your data and interview to seek if you can find the opposite."
6360,2021-05-25T14:51:30.837000+00:00,its just cause that way I have the least amount of risk due to assumptions
6361,2021-05-25T14:51:07.537000+00:00,if that makes sense
6362,2021-05-25T14:51:04.853000+00:00,until its proven wrong (after I dig further)
6363,2021-05-25T14:50:54.758000+00:00,thats why usually I use that as the main
6364,2021-05-25T14:50:45.250000+00:00,but data is data is data (unless its measured incorrectly)
6365,2021-05-25T14:50:26.120000+00:00,yeah what people say is not aways = what they do
6366,2021-05-25T14:50:06.725000+00:00,"Yeah, I've noticed especially when interviewing opinions there's a lot of political correctness. As in they will say ""Yes I do care about privacy"" but then by measuring the actual behaviour they give their facebook data for every easy log in."
6367,2021-05-25T14:47:45.430000+00:00,"is it just because ""gut feel?"""
6368,2021-05-25T14:47:32.252000+00:00,its more why is it different
6369,2021-05-25T14:47:23.967000+00:00,its not that the user is wrong
6370,2021-05-25T14:47:03.576000+00:00,Makes sense yeah
6371,2021-05-25T14:47:02.745000+00:00,yeah
6372,2021-05-25T14:47:01.753000+00:00,cause ratings I consider qual
6373,2021-05-25T14:46:59.690000+00:00,"Ahh, so in the sense of actually measuring speed etc"
6374,2021-05-25T14:46:56.392000+00:00,"like physical measurements vs ""rating"" quant"
6375,2021-05-25T14:46:44.866000+00:00,depends on the survey but i was thinking more eg actual time studies
6376,2021-05-25T14:46:28.094000+00:00,"Depends, if it's a survey it's still biased"
6377,2021-05-25T14:46:16.992000+00:00,it has no bias
6378,2021-05-25T14:46:11.203000+00:00,quant is shallow but its the actual measured
6379,2021-05-25T14:45:57.204000+00:00,yes and no
6380,2021-05-25T14:45:55.680000+00:00,As quant is rather shallow
6381,2021-05-25T14:45:25.040000+00:00,Wouldn't you say the qualitative data is the real data?
6382,2021-05-25T14:45:08.644000+00:00,like that should be the basis if theres a disagreement
6383,2021-05-25T14:44:54.103000+00:00,cause the quantitative data is the real data imo
6384,2021-05-25T14:44:46.569000+00:00,then you have to find out why they are telling you something else
6385,2021-05-25T14:44:36.192000+00:00,they dont have to be kept separate
6386,2021-05-25T14:44:21.007000+00:00,"For example; maybe I found data through user shadowing, but by interviewing they will tell me something else"
6387,2021-05-25T14:43:16.273000+00:00,Would one also divide qualitative and quantitative data in this sense?
6388,2021-05-25T14:42:54.091000+00:00,then why that and why ... etc
6389,2021-05-25T14:42:46.260000+00:00,"then u go ""why is cheese yellow"""
6390,2021-05-25T14:42:43.357000+00:00,"Then go deeper in the biology, physics, whatever"
6391,2021-05-25T14:42:35.611000+00:00,yes
6392,2021-05-25T14:42:26.161000+00:00,yeah ahhaha its not great when things are inter linked
6393,2021-05-25T14:42:23.186000+00:00,Like; cheese is yellow
6394,2021-05-25T14:42:14.827000+00:00,"Yeah, just insight statements"
6395,2021-05-25T14:42:07.138000+00:00,"Nice nice, this diagram I really enjoy. Was trying to do the same thing with circle diagrams, just didn't work very well"
6396,2021-05-25T14:42:04.094000+00:00,just insight
6397,2021-05-25T14:42:01.992000+00:00,but not solution yet
6398,2021-05-25T14:41:21.375000+00:00,yeah
6399,2021-05-25T14:40:43.318000+00:00,Per insight I imagine
6400,2021-05-25T14:40:40.696000+00:00,so the smaller branch might be dug deeper for all the different issues there
6401,2021-05-25T14:40:22.531000+00:00,thats a key point
6402,2021-05-25T14:40:18.323000+00:00,fishmaps can drill down
6403,2021-05-25T14:40:14.172000+00:00,but what i will say though is
6404,2021-05-25T14:40:09.037000+00:00,but you can always revise it üôÇ
6405,2021-05-25T14:40:03.633000+00:00,just one fish map
6406,2021-05-25T14:39:58.443000+00:00,naw
6407,2021-05-25T14:39:48.016000+00:00,"As in, does my first fish map maybe show the order I was previously thinking is the bad one?"
6408,2021-05-25T14:39:23.343000+00:00,"Mhh, is fishmapping iterative then?"
6409,2021-05-25T14:37:56.807000+00:00,might have to wait until you see it to say for sure
6410,2021-05-25T14:37:44.007000+00:00,i cant tell right now haha my bad
6411,2021-05-25T14:37:14.257000+00:00,Or; Not keeping distance at coffee machine
6412,2021-05-25T14:36:59.440000+00:00,So I imagine an effect would be: Preferring face to face contact
6413,2021-05-25T14:36:27.300000+00:00,no problem
6414,2021-05-25T14:36:25.099000+00:00,yeah!
6415,2021-05-25T14:36:22.604000+00:00,Thanks! I'm going to try and make one
6416,2021-05-25T14:34:43.994000+00:00,But that's why too chaotic to consume easily
6417,2021-05-25T14:34:36.573000+00:00,Yeah first I had something like this
6418,2021-05-25T14:34:31.476000+00:00,
6419,2021-05-25T14:33:58.561000+00:00,so thats why it helps
6420,2021-05-25T14:33:53.771000+00:00,usually on causes sometimes branch off too
6421,2021-05-25T14:33:37.840000+00:00,its a key tool for root causing
6422,2021-05-25T14:33:32.717000+00:00,I used to use this alot for process improvement
6423,2021-05-25T14:33:24.902000+00:00,yeah!
6424,2021-05-25T14:33:21.561000+00:00,Especially with some observations
6425,2021-05-25T14:33:10.708000+00:00,"Nice, I think that may work very well yeah!"
6426,2021-05-25T14:32:39.863000+00:00,yes
6427,2021-05-25T14:32:16.784000+00:00,
6428,2021-05-25T14:32:14.397000+00:00,So basically something like?
6429,2021-05-25T14:31:10.067000+00:00,I know fishbone maps with artifact analysing
6430,2021-05-25T14:31:00.718000+00:00,a mind map is good but harder to follow
6431,2021-05-25T14:30:55.697000+00:00,Let me check out fish mapping
6432,2021-05-25T14:30:48.893000+00:00,I thought maybe this could work as well
6433,2021-05-25T14:30:37.880000+00:00,Exactly the sort of 5 why indeed!
6434,2021-05-25T14:30:18.337000+00:00,because youre essentially trying to show a 5 Why almost
6435,2021-05-25T14:30:07.825000+00:00,I think that might actually be more suitable for your application here
6436,2021-05-25T14:29:53.298000+00:00,<@!209640428151111680> check out fishbone maps
6437,2021-05-25T14:29:47.433000+00:00,I actually thoought it was a process flow map haha
6438,2021-05-25T14:29:06.825000+00:00,"Thanks for the input though! Then I know I might need to make some changes, in order to display it as something going deeper instead"
6439,2021-05-25T14:23:18.804000+00:00,Ahhh I see! I think without context of the method i was trying to read it like an affinity map haha. Just a matter of presentation. I think it works great for those familiar with laddering analysis!
6440,2021-05-25T13:38:49.834000+00:00,You think it would make more sense to present it the other way around?
6441,2021-05-25T13:38:23.623000+00:00,"It's an attempt to doing laddering analysis, based on transcriptions. So the yellow would be the surface observation, while blue with be the core value behind the behaviour"
6442,2021-05-25T13:37:28.401000+00:00,
6443,2021-05-25T13:36:45.363000+00:00,"I suppose the final themes are more supposed to be core values, based on the value graph of Schwartz"
6444,2021-05-25T13:18:12.202000+00:00,"Hey! It is, but I was just wondering why you decided to put the final themes/findings at the bottom instead of above the yellow labels as larger overall themes? It seems to me like some of the blue ones are higher level themes of the yellow ones? (eg. Friendship is the theme encompassing ‚Äòi come to the office‚Äô) For a while the arrows and top to bottom flow made it seem like x led to y. üôÇ"
6445,2021-05-25T09:14:58.790000+00:00,
6446,2021-05-25T09:14:52.789000+00:00,"If you guys look at this graph without context, is it obvious what it attempts to convey?"
6447,2021-05-24T01:40:48.633000+00:00,Here's a useful article on how to choose your ux research methods according to your objective üôÇ https://link.medium.com/FNyB56mxvgb
6448,2021-05-23T14:50:23.208000+00:00,"interesting I didn't realize they had a session recording feature, this is exactly what i would need ty üôÇ"
6449,2021-05-23T14:47:13.751000+00:00,Something like Hotjar?
6450,2021-05-23T14:46:55.920000+00:00,"Does anyone have any reccomendations for websites like Maze, but for exisiting websites? It looks like Maze you can only enter a prototype link"
6451,2021-05-23T14:37:15.202000+00:00,"Nobody cares about the statistics, if it doesn't imply what to do because of those statistics."
6452,2021-05-23T14:34:24.769000+00:00,"You want to present actionable conclusions, visions, strategy (that are based on data)"
6453,2021-05-23T14:34:10.122000+00:00,"Yeah, one mistake I often made is presenting too much raw data to stakeholders"
6454,2021-05-23T12:40:35.612000+00:00,What is the experimental set up and why
6455,2021-05-23T12:40:28.415000+00:00,What is the best way to present your findings and data visually
6456,2021-05-23T12:40:12.991000+00:00,^exactly
6457,2021-05-23T12:26:54.701000+00:00,The idea is that any designer could glance at your research and easily use it
6458,2021-05-23T12:26:25.432000+00:00,"End products are usually design principles, or recommendations"
6459,2021-05-23T12:25:41.445000+00:00,They're not going to read your entire report either
6460,2021-05-23T12:25:33.513000+00:00,I guess it's a bit like presenting the research to a case owner
6461,2021-05-23T05:06:46.708000+00:00,Or how different attributes might change the data
6462,2021-05-23T05:06:29.398000+00:00,And how are you going to validate those and Elininate potential biases
6463,2021-05-23T05:06:14.744000+00:00,Keep focusing back on what the key hypothesis and assumptions are
6464,2021-05-23T05:02:12.524000+00:00,Or ‚ÄúI would kinda want x‚Äù
6465,2021-05-23T05:02:00.136000+00:00,Always tie it back into the persona vs ‚ÄúI feel like it would be nice if it had this‚Äù
6466,2021-05-23T05:01:30.688000+00:00,And on top remember to show how it‚Äôs not self centered design meaning designing for yourself
6467,2021-05-23T05:01:01.397000+00:00,Rather than only focusing on qualitative
6468,2021-05-23T05:00:52.454000+00:00,From that then I would advise to try and formulate more data into it
6469,2021-05-23T04:59:28.640000+00:00,"that makes a lot more sense, I just started a passion project where I created a mobile prototype for my old workplace at a dispensary that offers online ordering but has a horrible ui for mobile, I‚Äôve put a lot of my personal experiences and interactions with customers into identifying the users/stake holders and creating the personas and scenarios and I‚Äôm now starting to plan out what research methods I would implement but I don‚Äôt know if my final report/presentation would lack substance to someone reading it if I don‚Äôt have any data analysis or key takeaways if i never conducted any of the research methods, hopefully I will figure something out but thank you for the advice it has given me a lot of insight on how I can make a more research based portfolio üôÇ"
6470,2021-05-23T04:23:04.598000+00:00,Surveys are only one tool within UX Research and they are plenty more tools I think personally I would explain in the case study the research plan the methodology and why you picked those tools
6471,2021-05-23T04:22:26.508000+00:00,Right now I‚Äôm in that sort of environment and I defintely gravitate to research as well
6472,2021-05-23T04:21:44.333000+00:00,The role of a UX researcher is very different from that of a designer
6473,2021-05-23T04:21:33.116000+00:00,Depends on the company but for bigger places where research and design is separate
6474,2021-05-23T04:20:52.010000+00:00,From my experience I would say yes you can form a portfolio of pure UXR
6475,2021-05-23T04:20:24.636000+00:00,It‚Äôs not a dumb question at all
6476,2021-05-23T04:17:30.097000+00:00,i don‚Äôt know if this was a dumb question to ask
6477,2021-05-23T04:08:30.346000+00:00,"hi all, I just recently found out what I want to do with my life and there are a lot of UX research positions I would like to apply to but I would also like to be able to show a portfolio. I would just like to know how I would be able to form a portfolio if it is more on the research side and less on the prototyping part? What would a ux research portfolio look like if I don‚Äôt have a lot of participants to take surveys so I can conduct the proper research methods?"
6478,2021-05-23T02:16:37.872000+00:00,<@!464557539845996584> <@!775579834269040640> hi all - please refrain from discussing other design servers in design buddies!
6479,2021-05-21T00:09:22.065000+00:00,snap has new AR glasses <#810601718403432518>
6480,2021-05-20T19:03:17.156000+00:00,"This however also depends which country your from, in some countries it's much harder to approach strangers than others."
6481,2021-05-20T19:02:50.265000+00:00,Just comes down to basic networking I suppose. Got to the places your users are and connect with them. Being social and not being too shy to speak to people.
6482,2021-05-20T19:01:41.767000+00:00,"If I'd need people who travel I'd go to the airport and just speak to people there at random, they're waiting anyway"
6483,2021-05-20T18:57:57.105000+00:00,"Some users are very easy to approach, some are a bit harder. Like teachers are often very open to testing software used for education. Then if I'd need students too, I'd first set up networks with teacher and after getting to know them, I'll try and see if I can get students through that person as well"
6484,2021-05-20T18:57:29.757000+00:00,"But yeah, heavily depends on who you need."
6485,2021-05-20T18:56:30.259000+00:00,But now with covid it's a little differently
6486,2021-05-20T18:56:18.791000+00:00,Sometimes I'd just randomly approach people on the street
6487,2021-05-20T18:55:36.211000+00:00,Kind of depends on the users needed
6488,2021-05-20T17:20:43.116000+00:00,I'd email them before hand and set up a time to meet. As if you called them without warning they might not answer or they might be busy. And depending on the topic you might need to brief them or send over a release form depending on how you are using the data
6489,2021-05-20T17:12:44.449000+00:00,"How do you recruit users for interviews? I already have contact information from many responses through a survey. Should I just pick up the phone, call and interview them, or just send them an email beforehand?"
6490,2021-05-20T12:45:38.542000+00:00,"Guys, Can anyone suggest me a online available project me on HRMS  for reference"
6491,2021-05-20T05:43:41.103000+00:00,ohhh true. thanks üôÇ
6492,2021-05-19T20:47:41.562000+00:00,E-commerce UX will be very different from self-driving cars
6493,2021-05-19T20:47:23.143000+00:00,Mostly industry depended I'd say though
6494,2021-05-19T20:47:01.682000+00:00,I suppose there are a lot of very specific UX positions
6495,2021-05-19T20:25:28.830000+00:00,"that makes sense, thank you! also asking bc i recently met a senior ux designer who wanted to know ""what kind of work i was planning"" so he could send me helpful resources to check out, but not exactly sure what he meant by that, and thought maybe there were more specific positions within ux design"
6496,2021-05-19T13:39:59.371000+00:00,Yeah same here it overlaps often the designers will lead on the testing because they understand the solution more. Plus our teams have one researcher and three designers so the work is spread a bit more
6497,2021-05-19T13:08:20.964000+00:00,Especially user testing and all
6498,2021-05-19T13:07:29.810000+00:00,"Yeah, sometimes even with companies who have them separate. Depending on the researching budget, the UXers themselves can still do research if the research isn't too extensive in the project."
6499,2021-05-19T09:17:30.811000+00:00,Yeah I've seen more start-up style companies having UXers who do research and design. Where I work we have Researchers and Designers in separate roles as well as product/delivery managers and specialists managing each individual contributor too. So it varies a lot!
6500,2021-05-19T08:56:46.475000+00:00,"Kind of depends, a lot of UXers do both. But some larger companies have purely UX researchers yeah"
6501,2021-05-19T05:17:51.025000+00:00,"i just noticed this ux research server is separate from the ux design server, but are these two separate fields that you can work in? (currently trying to  learn more about careers in ux ü•µ )"
6502,2021-05-19T03:43:26.053000+00:00,Thanks for this!
6503,2021-05-18T21:03:57.852000+00:00,<#757108348394012770>  üòâ I believe theres lots of information there to start with
6504,2021-05-18T17:21:12.883000+00:00,Ok. Great. Thank you! üòä
6505,2021-05-18T17:18:03.976000+00:00,https://fivesecondtest.com/
6506,2021-05-18T17:18:02.814000+00:00,This is also fun
6507,2021-05-18T17:14:49.570000+00:00,But personally I don't have much experience doing quantitative methods
6508,2021-05-18T17:14:35.357000+00:00,I know some people use Lookback
6509,2021-05-18T17:12:25.341000+00:00,Great. Thank you for the input! Any platform recommendations?
6510,2021-05-18T16:45:42.193000+00:00,The most important thing is to iterate the research
6511,2021-05-18T16:45:29.832000+00:00,"This is very personal too, not really one good way"
6512,2021-05-18T16:43:38.638000+00:00,"Sort of, depending how you use it"
6513,2021-05-18T16:43:33.501000+00:00,So the research would be every fourth sprint in this model (given your sprints are 1 week)
6514,2021-05-18T16:42:16.308000+00:00,Here each section can be 1 sprint
6515,2021-05-18T16:40:42.748000+00:00,How many really depends on project length
6516,2021-05-18T16:40:22.974000+00:00,
6517,2021-05-18T16:40:20.981000+00:00,One model I like to use is Mendel
6518,2021-05-18T16:39:02.479000+00:00,Oh i see. How many sprints does it normally take?
6519,2021-05-18T16:36:52.090000+00:00,"Well since you will discover new things / new data with each sprints, the research becomes interwind with the process rather than just 1 sprint"
6520,2021-05-18T16:36:13.863000+00:00,"Sorry, could u elaborate more on this?"
6521,2021-05-18T16:35:51.150000+00:00,Thanks!
6522,2021-05-18T16:31:30.124000+00:00,Then do 5 new ones again to get deeper into the why
6523,2021-05-18T16:31:14.453000+00:00,"Then another sprint for data analysis, seeing what's missing"
6524,2021-05-18T16:30:10.540000+00:00,"I usually try to aim for like 5 qualitative interviews per sprint of around 30 min each, with a more exploratory mindset"
6525,2021-05-18T16:29:39.522000+00:00,In an agile environment it would be very context depended
6526,2021-05-18T16:28:33.680000+00:00,https://www.nngroup.com/articles/task-scenarios-usability-testing/
6527,2021-05-18T16:28:26.850000+00:00,You could use task scenarios!
6528,2021-05-18T16:28:06.115000+00:00,Oh hopefully you'll get better soon!
6529,2021-05-18T16:25:13.186000+00:00,"How do u guys conduct your research in an agile environment? What‚Äôs your process like and how meaningful would your findings be? In terms of user interviews, how many pax would be enough to gather rich data?"
6530,2021-05-18T15:57:17.312000+00:00,Also we need to do design changes so some feedback on that as well
6531,2021-05-18T15:55:03.574000+00:00,I am actually trying to understand how smoothly can the users go through the webapp and what are the issues they are facing while using the webapp
6532,2021-05-18T15:53:51.868000+00:00,Actually I am not well at the moment and that seemed like the only way
6533,2021-05-18T15:43:31.234000+00:00,What is the specific thing you'd like to test?
6534,2021-05-18T15:43:08.460000+00:00,"They aren't insightful with small numbers, because they will never tell you why something happens"
6535,2021-05-18T15:42:08.864000+00:00,"Unmoderated tests are only useful if you have many many people to test with, that you couldn't test with face to face"
6536,2021-05-18T15:41:42.512000+00:00,Greetings <@!754178745618923541> that depends what you are trying to test!
6537,2021-05-18T15:28:08.215000+00:00,"Hi. I have to do some usability test for our mvp. I am new to this and not sure where to start. I was thinking card sorting and unmoderated test.
Please suggest what will you use and which website will you use for the same.

Thank you!"
6538,2021-05-18T14:54:02.516000+00:00,"Hy ! Um, I wanted to ask How to get started w/ making my first case study ? Like I k the topic I want to work on .. but making a case study seems very daunting.. since I am a beginner I wanted to learn-by-creating but I don't how to learn about User Flows  or terms such as Impact/ Effort matrix ? Is there anyway I can learn more about these ?"
6539,2021-05-16T21:36:49.415000+00:00,I think things like atomic research can be formatted as simple as in some excel docs
6540,2021-05-16T21:15:56.959000+00:00,"Is your business already using some sort of central document store? Confluence, Sharepoint?"
6541,2021-05-16T19:15:52.365000+00:00,I was more looking for software that can help me with this? I feel like google drive isn't really well suited for this job and there are things like Dovetail and EnjoyHQ that might be better but I've never used either of them and I don't know anyone personally who has either
6542,2021-05-16T19:14:28.098000+00:00,"What are you looking for, in terms of recommendations? How to set up the repositories of all the research that's been done at a company, so that its easily accessible and able to be referenced later?"
6543,2021-05-16T18:27:06.832000+00:00,"Hey, does anyone have an recommendations on research repositories? I've been reading a bit about them but at my work we just have a crazy google drive with everything in it. For context where I work there is around 100 - 200 employees"
6544,2021-05-15T11:52:06.452000+00:00,A lot
6545,2021-05-15T11:52:04.444000+00:00,Or does he know he‚Äôs changing
6546,2021-05-15T11:51:59.401000+00:00,I think what‚Äôs important is to constantly write things down then
6547,2021-05-15T11:04:09.393000+00:00,Yeah sounds like a difficult case indeedüòµ
6548,2021-05-15T10:26:25.441000+00:00,Our approach now is if he becomes difficult via emails we arrange meeting time over Teams to allow him to verbalise his feelings and listen. We don't reply to his emails apart from to arrange a call/meeting because that allows misunderstandings.
6549,2021-05-15T10:25:18.139000+00:00,"So we are a large organisation and his charity is being contracted by us. As part of the contract we are bringing his operations onto our system for mutual benefit. He will not be the user of the system but he has a stake as he is the 'charity lead'. He has the power to breach contract/stop the project etc. 
We do believe there have been misunderstandings on the way, we continue to be patient and have everything in writing so he cannot say we have not met our end of the deal"
6550,2021-05-15T10:20:45.559000+00:00,"In some sense you could just call him out on it, might just be a mutual misunderstanding"
6551,2021-05-15T10:19:10.780000+00:00,How much power does he hold in terms of the project?
6552,2021-05-15T10:18:29.141000+00:00,"Is he the PM, Client, what is his role in the story?"
6553,2021-05-15T10:16:37.134000+00:00,What type of stakeholder was he?
6554,2021-05-15T10:16:01.181000+00:00,Essentially we have done everything he asks for and he moves the goal post
6555,2021-05-15T10:15:14.229000+00:00,He feels that way but we do in fact listen and act on his needs and what he asks of us but then he changes and its hard to keep track of what wants
6556,2021-05-15T10:14:29.148000+00:00,no we moved away from the user journey to focus on JBTD and he then got angry that we hadn't focussed on the user journey. We focussed on the user journey and the new prototype etc and he then said our prototype was too similar to the original user journey if that makes sense
6557,2021-05-15T02:19:32.268000+00:00,Stakeholders aren‚Äôt always right but managing them is a super important albeit difficult skill
6558,2021-05-15T02:19:06.191000+00:00,Is it possible the stakeholder just feels like they aren‚Äôt being listened to?
6559,2021-05-14T21:28:31.916000+00:00,Also what type of stakeholder is this? What are his responsibilities?
6560,2021-05-14T21:26:57.543000+00:00,"So basically, he wants a JTBD approach, you guys did a user journey instead and now he's angry?"
6561,2021-05-14T20:40:35.015000+00:00,*!
6562,2021-05-14T20:40:33.020000+00:00,No problem‚Äô
6563,2021-05-14T16:29:27.369000+00:00,That's a good suggestion thank you!
6564,2021-05-14T16:07:39.407000+00:00,"One example of how he is difficult is when it came to mapping their existing user journeys. When trying to do that he pushed back stating he didn't want to focus too much on that and focus more on the 'jobs to be done approach' so we quietly mapped the user journey without much input from him.
Then a few weeks later he sent a boisterious email that were not focussing enough on HOW the users do things currently.
So we then do all the user journey maps and continue with the project and start crafting an ideal journey/process and prototype. 
He then goes right back and complains that the new process is too much like how they already do things.
Thats just one example. Moving the goal posts, not happy with any direction we take, if that makes sense"

6568,2021-05-14T06:15:34.447000+00:00,In which way are they difficult?

6570,2021-05-13T15:36:58.801000+00:00,"Hi all, interested to find out a couple of things. Recently I've been dealing with quite a difficult stakeholder as part of a project. They are quite hard to deal with, indecisive and unyielding in anything. Can also come across a bit of bully! So my questions (more for discussion than a FAQ) are:
- do others find as the UX researchers in the team they often have to bear the difficult personalities of users/stakeholders more than others?
- any tips on how to deal with challenging stakeholders?
The key here is this person is not actually the user of the solution but contractually has a stake in the design if that makes sense"

6573,2021-05-13T01:21:29.177000+00:00,are there any associations or licensing bodies that you could reach out to who might be able to post on your behalf so their members could reach out?

6575,2021-05-12T13:50:36.248000+00:00,"this is something that was practiced at the previous company i worked at. I was the new hire who got asked how to improve our app and i thought it was actually quite great to get myself more acquainted with the company and what we were doing. Giving feedback to ppl working on the app was also a chance to make a first impression on the team as well. So although it was a little stressful, it was a valuable opportunity. I recently also tried the new hire testing stuff out on two interns in the new company I'm working in.

It can be helpful to have a template or guidelines on how they're going to provide feedback. Are you going to do a live user testing type session? or will they go off and prepare a presentation of sorts and come back with their feedback on how the app can be improved? If you do the latter then maybe you can have them go through Jakob Nielsen's  10 heuristics, and have them assign severity ratings to their pain points. This is what the interns did at my current company and we were able to immediately take their feedback and work on improving the app with it. 
 
I think it can be a bit difficult to get accurate emotional reactions from new hires, maybe due to the power dynamic as <@!261157243783741440> mentioned. So on that note, maybe it will be easier to get information from them where they can go off on their own time and frame their reactions in more objective ways. But however you choose to do it I think it's totally valid that you'd interview New Hires if they're going to be your users!"

Actually the tool isn't only internal, we have clients who also use it. And the idea to get first hand feedback from new hires, it's just the first step in 'adding more empathy' in the Product Design process. 

But yes, I will definitely keep those in mind."

Does anyone has some experiences/resources to share about User Testing (empathizing) with New Hires?
Basically imagine you have a product that new hires will be using almost day by day (after they get hired), and I am thinking to get their first impressions on that product. Because later they/we tend to not see the obvious things.

As an example, Slack is doing a lot of internal testing, as everyone in the company uses Slack. And imagine that you hire a few interns that never used Slack before. Wouldn't they be a good pool for testing?

p.s. Yes, I know it's not recommended to do internal user testing and so on... I am just curious if anyone worked on something around this topic."

6591,2021-05-08T21:30:07.673000+00:00,"Neat case study, Jeevanshu! Good, short read on what work you did. One thing that stands out to me as a possible improvement, in terms of reporting UX Research (and all just my thoughts, so take it with a grain of salt) - I generally follow a format that starts with the insights, the top 3-5 most important take-aways that describe user needs, problems or challenges and point towards an opportunity space, and then follow with relevant data pieces and explanation that back them up. 

In your report, I see the large pictures for the interviews/responses, which is neat to see, but I almost guarantee that no hiring manager or fellow researcher will read those closely, much less read them entirely. Shorten the data you are presenting to that which is relevant to your insights and findings. On that note, the list of 20 (!!) ""insights/problems/surprises"" really just is a list of findings. If you shorten to a smaller list, turn them into some insights that mean something rather are just observations, and back with data from the interviews and what you've found - then this builds a much more powerful case for the suggestions and the rigor of your work."
6592,2021-05-08T17:37:35.929000+00:00,"Right, so I've been looking around for quite some while over twitter and the debate going around that feature. The overall objective of trying to initiate the discussion was to understand how user behaviour changes when things don't stay the same as they used to as the feature is by default and not an option. The break in the uniformity of the feed and it's implications on the thought process of users was something I was looking at."

6613,2021-05-06T14:12:02+00:00,"""Stakeholders"" typically means anyone who has any sort of investment in the final product. This could be investors, as they care about growth and money, it could be users, as they care about the experience they have and the services they receive. Depending on the product it could be a lot of things.

For a concrete example: I work in Education and Curriculum Design. When I am designing learning materials I have to consider the following stakeholders: The board of education, who has a political investment in the project; the teachers who will be teaching the curriculum; the students who will be interacting with the curriculum; the administrators of schools that will be paying for the curriculum; the parents who will want to know what their kids are learning; the trainers who will be teaching other teachers how to use the curriculum. There is no one correct way to define a stakeholder, but identifying all of the people who have some sort of investment in the success of the project is important for understanding the needs of the user base"

6638,2021-04-29T17:43:14.004000+00:00,"Yeah, that's what it seemed like to me but I wasn't sure. Haha. Thanks for responding Nawdia!"
6639,2021-04-29T17:41:28.306000+00:00,"not a UX researcher but when i hear the word ""coordinator"", what comes to mind are junior-level type and support related responsibilities in which you would help aid your direct report under"
6640,2021-04-29T17:24:08.558000+00:00,"Hi Buddies, I've been looking into junior (or entry level) ux research jobs and came across some job postings for a ux research coordinator. How is a ux researcher role different from a ux research coordinator role, or are these about the same thing? I've been curious about it for a while. Thanks!!!"
6641,2021-04-27T18:47:05.815000+00:00,"Right, I think when we start looking at smaller organizations and companies that have just a few UXR roles (or maybe just one UXR team), I would be surprised if they are doing much of any quantitative work beyond some simple A/B testing or some linear regression if given some larger analytics data to improve user experiences in some way. That said, super useful to know the more complicated/in-depth stats stuff for working with data science teams or quant UXR/researchers when in those companies that have them."
6642,2021-04-27T17:58:43.727000+00:00,Good to know! I'll keep that in mind when applying to jobs in the future.
6643,2021-04-27T17:30:34.442000+00:00,Could be wrong though

6650,2021-04-27T14:41:29.799000+00:00,"Yeah, HCI isn't the exact same as UX too though!"
6651,2021-04-27T14:22:43.250000+00:00,"Absolutely. I've slowly been wondering if what I really want to do is HCI or pure psychology research rather than UX, although there's definitely a lot of overlap between these fields. I do still have some time to figure things out üôÇ And thank you for the insight!"
6652,2021-04-27T14:08:27.023000+00:00,Another difference in UX and social research is that with UX you're researching a 'future scenario' something that does not exist yet. While social sciences research something that already exists.
6653,2021-04-27T14:00:54.649000+00:00,"I guess it's both a pro and con especially in more the digital marketing side. Business owners don't have to understand why things work, they just need to see the number goes up instead of down üòÇ"
6654,2021-04-27T13:58:26.250000+00:00,Yeah I guess the main difference between the psychology/social sciences too is with whom your communicating too. Research Peers vs company owners

6656,2021-04-27T13:56:07.619000+00:00,Thanks for the reply! Structural equation modeling is used mostly in psychology/social sciences research so I was hoping it could be applied to UX as well. I spoke with the professor and she will let me try the class out for a bit before deciding if I want to enroll üòÄ
6657,2021-04-27T07:13:48.593000+00:00,"Structural Equation Modeling feels like something which is mainly useful between scientist sharing their findings, rather than sharing it in a business case. But then again, I may be very wrong in that."

6663,2021-04-26T16:52:54.644000+00:00,And yeah I agree since it's mostly about the content but I wanted to gauge sentiments or perception between our old and new email since we recently redesigned it.

6683,2021-04-24T17:19:27.942000+00:00,"You'd be surprised how willing people are to share information when asked, even on sensitive topics that they posted about to a Facebook Health group. That said, the information from those posts could be useful and beneficial - do they directly give data and possible answers to research questions you have for this case study? Are you trying analyze how people share information and feelings about their own health, specifically? While the data might be more informal and not directed to specific questions you have, it can be a good source of generative data.

Also important considerations- it may be unethical in some sense to take responses from groups like these as sources of data, as the ""participants"" may not be explicitly consenting to participate in research or to contribute their data to studies like these - this may depend on whether its a public or private group, as well as the rules / notices for the group it self. Very much a YMMV case.
Additionally, may need to consider the sort of self-filtering that may go on, as those that post to the group may be by-and-large different from the users you are targeting or have interviewed so far - they are seeking out a place to put their thoughts and experiences on a FB group, may be a different mentality from the user group overall."

6688,2021-04-24T13:55:30.641000+00:00,Yea I thought of the same.. like having a timer to take a decision would speed up the process.. a non-designer work colleague kinda misinterpreted parkinson's law to mean that we can put restrictions such as number of clicks and and stuff and we'll somehow creatively come up with a solution with those constraints checked.

6701,2021-04-23T11:11:28.769000+00:00,My recent project has been focussing a lot on teams. For personas we decided to break down the team as how each 'user' would interact with the product. What their role in the team is and how they would interact with it then creating different personas based on that. There was a lot of overlap and it became a struggle to identify who's needs come first but it MAY be a helpful exercise on top of anything else you do.

Either way should follow a similar recruitment plan, and this is probably something I'd do for almost any recruitment problem:

- Start with the most ideal users, either that the nonprofit has access to or similar. Whether they are users of a specific product/tool, or fit some range of criteria, identify that and see if there is a way to get access to them. This might mean asking the nonprofit contacts/client, they should have some idea of how to get to them.
- If those users aren't available, find next best - get a list of criteria that makes up the ideal user and find ways to find communities of them and then solicit at those communities (where allowed). They may not be actual users of the nonprofit's services/products, but will get you close. 
- Lastly, use that criteria from above to set up a screener on a common testing platform, like usertesting.com. This method can be really hit or miss, as some may just pass through the criteria but not fit the right description, much less complete a survey or usability test in a way that gives valuable insight.

2. There is no golden rule to have 100 user to survey. (however if you want, you can post it in <#708809627260944436> ) 
3. There is also no golden rule for process... I would suggest you to go ahead with the 20 survey results and develop the wireframe, you can then go ahead and do a quantitative analysis on the wireframe to identify further problem statements and refine them.. you could only need 3-5 participants to do this.
4. Nobody is gonna challenge you on the number of participants, all they are concerned about  is your approach and critical thinking ability
5. Make sure to mention your constraints or assumptions related to the problem statement or data collected while making the case study."

For context:

I was joined UI/UX Bootcamp last year, and I still have a UX Study Case that still in the middle of the research phase. It was postponed for several months (because I was busy with my 'real' job) and I want to continue that right now.

Problem:

In the research progress, I was only used 20 participants for the survey method. The question is, Is that number of participants is enough for 'just' my personal project UX Study Case?. I know that the minimum for a survey is 100, but I only work by myself now, and kinda feel that I will put a lot of effort to synthesize all data.

I'm thinking to do an interview to validate the problem from the survey/research question on 3 - 5 participants (It means that I already synthesize all data from the previous 20 participants survey and make wireframe) while continue to do usability testing. I really want your opinion about that, so if someone will challenge my method I know what to answer :). Thank you!."

So many ways this could have gone sideways; we had no prep for a formal presentation, the participant could have been so frazzled by the CEO‚Äôs presence he wouldn‚Äôt speak, or we could have been unable to field comments from the CEO, but we did all of it and the participant had little difficulty speaking his mind in front of the CEO. TBF, it was one of the least ideal situations for a user test, but the end result was the participant saying, ‚Äúthat was actually fun‚Äù and the CEO saying, ‚Äúcan I see the prototype?

We're in the research phase and are trying to make personas and empathy maps but it feels like alot of info is being left out.

Is it common practice to make a persona or empathy map for a whole team as one unit instead of a person?
I think we almost have to treat the whole team as one unit in the maps to fit in all info. Does that make sense? 

Does anyone else have any experience with this?"

6741,2021-04-12T08:35:45.536000+00:00,That's a good way of validating earlier interviews
6742,2021-04-12T08:34:03.348000+00:00,"Yeah, that's done quite often yeah"
6743,2021-04-11T23:28:34.201000+00:00,"You could code the answers, by either predefining according to the theory you are testing and/or sorting with the team of researchers afterwards."
6744,2021-04-11T17:41:50.142000+00:00,"Because open questions are only valuable when you can actually ask more questions based on the answer given, which you can't in a survey"

6746,2021-04-11T17:36:47.300000+00:00,How do you mean?
6747,2021-04-10T21:40:40.315000+00:00,question about user surveys - where does the line draw between open and closed ended questions?
6748,2021-04-06T16:29:07.550000+00:00,Unless they happen to be scientist
6749,2021-04-06T16:28:03.734000+00:00,Which no colleague is going to do for you
6750,2021-04-06T16:27:20.783000+00:00,Without needing to bleed through a Shakespeare size paper
6751,2021-04-06T16:27:00.165000+00:00,These kind of files make it easy to find / search for
6752,2021-04-06T16:26:15.055000+00:00,lol
6753,2021-04-06T16:26:14.110000+00:00,"So all the UX research ends in some paper, in some desk, along with 100 other"
6754,2021-04-06T16:25:51.235000+00:00,The reason this was created is because nobody wants to read papers
6755,2021-04-06T16:24:55.964000+00:00,
6756,2021-04-06T16:24:31.828000+00:00,YOu could make a picture of the notes I suppose
6757,2021-04-06T16:24:19.784000+00:00,Which is harder without recordings
6758,2021-04-06T16:23:36.095000+00:00,Usually you want to note the evidence too
6759,2021-04-06T16:23:13.855000+00:00,
6760,2021-04-06T16:23:07.866000+00:00,Probably with excel!
6761,2021-04-06T16:21:04.573000+00:00,"Intresting, how this would work with qualitative data?"
6762,2021-04-06T16:16:07.201000+00:00,Then it becomes much easier to communicate to people and ideate on
6763,2021-04-06T16:15:26.281000+00:00,Create statements based on data and save those instead
6764,2021-04-06T16:15:14.129000+00:00,https://www.designkit.org/methods/create-insight-statements
6765,2021-04-06T16:15:13.424000+00:00,"And another useful thing, to avoid raw data"
6766,2021-04-06T16:14:27.655000+00:00,Each point of data is an 'atom' in a big file
6767,2021-04-06T16:14:13.171000+00:00,This is a method used for managing a lot of data
6768,2021-04-06T16:13:36.726000+00:00,
6769,2021-04-06T16:13:08.544000+00:00,Another popular thing nowadays is atomic research (I suppose you can google that term and see a lot of different things)
6770,2021-04-06T16:12:57.096000+00:00,No worries!
6771,2021-04-06T16:11:32.949000+00:00,especially people that are more skilled and experienced
6772,2021-04-06T16:10:41.092000+00:00,"Thanks a lot! It's not things I've never heard of and actually I've used this techniques before, but seeing how other people approach them helps a lot"
6773,2021-04-06T16:09:05.564000+00:00,And the colors are the notes
6774,2021-04-06T16:08:59.178000+00:00,Where the text is voice instead
6775,2021-04-06T16:08:50.122000+00:00,Notes are just a way to do live qualitative coding
6776,2021-04-06T16:08:34.266000+00:00,"Yeah, you can do the same with notes really"
6777,2021-04-06T16:07:42.877000+00:00,"but i should be able to do that anyway, i guess"
6778,2021-04-06T16:07:23.961000+00:00,"Cool! I wish I had actual transcripts, but few users didn't want to get recorded so we decided to write reports in a more narrative manner"
6779,2021-04-06T16:07:18.014000+00:00,And put on walls to see new patterns
6780,2021-04-06T16:07:09.107000+00:00,Transfer over to post its
6781,2021-04-06T16:07:02.442000+00:00,
6782,2021-04-06T16:07:00.833000+00:00,Then you cluster like this
6783,2021-04-06T16:06:14.292000+00:00,Here I made pre-made themes because I wanted to create a persona though
6784,2021-04-06T16:04:59.638000+00:00,Each color represents something specific
6785,2021-04-06T16:04:46.172000+00:00,
6786,2021-04-06T16:04:44.506000+00:00,THen something like this
6787,2021-04-06T16:04:15.893000+00:00,Or just do a word document
6788,2021-04-06T16:04:08.478000+00:00,Grab a few markers
6789,2021-04-06T16:04:04.125000+00:00,You can even print it out
6790,2021-04-06T16:03:59.842000+00:00,2500 words just read
6791,2021-04-06T16:03:29.201000+00:00,Cool! do you thing I need to do coding for 2500 words or in that case I can just read and extract interesting parts?
6792,2021-04-06T16:02:45.283000+00:00,Having it on a wall def helps with the bigger picture
6793,2021-04-06T16:02:40.481000+00:00,ive also used http://dovetailapp.com which is pretty great for collaborating online
6794,2021-04-06T16:02:10.583000+00:00,You just give 'colors' to the transcripts and seek patterns
6795,2021-04-06T16:01:56.092000+00:00,It will do the cluster for you
6796,2021-04-06T16:01:52.026000+00:00,Especially for big files
6797,2021-04-06T16:01:47.540000+00:00,"But yeah, qualilative coding software helps"
6798,2021-04-06T16:01:13.728000+00:00,Nice pictures guys! Can't wait to arrive to that stage:D
6799,2021-04-06T16:01:08.090000+00:00,Files of 100k words are being diagrammed
6800,2021-04-06T16:01:05.923000+00:00,"but yeah, start with raw notes. then group by category, then group the categories, then take a day or two, and then check back on it and pull insights"
6801,2021-04-06T16:00:57.943000+00:00,2500 should easssiiily be doable
6802,2021-04-06T16:00:44.410000+00:00,2000-2500. They're not actual word by word transcript tho
6803,2021-04-06T16:00:41.947000+00:00,Yup! They get massive!
6804,2021-04-06T16:00:22.889000+00:00,This is a working wall my team did pre-covid
6805,2021-04-06T15:59:57.388000+00:00,"Create clusters first, themes later"
6806,2021-04-06T15:59:48.572000+00:00,Then you probably want to use a group of people to start clustering (before you create themes)
6807,2021-04-06T15:59:21.990000+00:00,
6808,2021-04-06T15:59:16.943000+00:00,
6809,2021-04-06T15:59:07.847000+00:00,Big walls
6810,2021-04-06T15:59:06.422000+00:00,It helps putting it on walls too
6811,2021-04-06T15:58:27.105000+00:00,How much words are the transcriptions?
6812,2021-04-06T15:57:51.175000+00:00,thanks! I'll have a look!
6813,2021-04-06T15:56:55.277000+00:00,Basically cluster all themes together
6814,2021-04-06T15:56:41.795000+00:00,
6815,2021-04-06T15:54:36.382000+00:00,Example of a big affinity map
6816,2021-04-06T15:54:19.138000+00:00,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYzhgMZii3o&ab_channel=Quirkos-SimpleQualitativeAnalysisSoftware
6817,2021-04-06T15:53:52.369000+00:00,I use qualitative coding for big transcripts
6818,2021-04-06T15:52:44.932000+00:00,Any general suggestion on how to menage a large research project?
6819,2021-04-06T15:52:42.275000+00:00,"ahah yes, that sounds like a good advice."
6820,2021-04-06T15:51:08.666000+00:00,and not try to limit or meet some arbitrary notes * time thing
6821,2021-04-06T15:50:47.194000+00:00,You should probably just be taking notes of like.. things of note. üòõ
6822,2021-04-06T15:49:52.219000+00:00,I won't follow the 1 note per minute cause I don't want to end up with 1500 bits of data to group. that sounds a bit extreme
6823,2021-04-06T15:48:45.148000+00:00,Alright. Sounds like it's not going to be a problem then
6824,2021-04-06T15:47:27.094000+00:00,so the goal of an affinity diagram is to basically take an unmanageable amount of data and chunk it into manageable sizes
6825,2021-04-06T15:46:31.046000+00:00,its just a sorting exercise
6826,2021-04-06T15:46:20.495000+00:00,so that you can parse through it more easily
6827,2021-04-06T15:46:15.053000+00:00,"I mean, you're just doing logical groupings of ideas, insights, verbatims etc. into clusters/themes"
6828,2021-04-06T15:45:00.434000+00:00,do you have any experience on very large affinity diagrams? The research here is pretty big. Does it work nonetheless?
6829,2021-04-06T15:42:50.215000+00:00,number of notes =/= depth of insights
6830,2021-04-06T15:42:46.912000+00:00,Maybe have a better method of recording and notetaking
6831,2021-04-06T15:42:40.344000+00:00,or do some sort of collation exercise
6832,2021-04-06T15:42:36.396000+00:00,thats why you affinity diagram
6833,2021-04-06T15:39:17.199000+00:00,I'm scared to end up flooded by sticky notes lol
6834,2021-04-06T15:38:05.900000+00:00,and the interviews are between 30 and 90 minutes each
6835,2021-04-06T15:37:49.347000+00:00,so 24 in total
6836,2021-04-06T15:37:31.052000+00:00,but I'm doing interviews for 3 different type of users and 8 interviews for each group
6837,2021-04-06T15:36:42.610000+00:00,Which sounds reasonable for 15 minutes interviews
6838,2021-04-06T15:36:08.208000+00:00,"Yeah, I'm asking cause I've read an advice to get more or less 1 note per minutes of interview"
6839,2021-04-06T15:35:26.914000+00:00,ahah
6840,2021-04-06T15:35:19.031000+00:00,At least 0!
6841,2021-04-06T15:34:56.119000+00:00,"highly dependent on the participant, stimulus etc."
6842,2021-04-06T15:34:44.128000+00:00,Not sure you can generalize like that

6868,2021-04-03T01:10:25.156000+00:00,"Hey friends, when you have quantitative data at numbers that reaches over 100+, how do you draw conclusions when the answers are so different? (Not one word answers)."
6869,2021-04-02T17:16:25.702000+00:00,Sounds useful for research indeed!
6870,2021-04-02T17:08:28.414000+00:00,"- yeah, i view product / business / systems design as having the same origin point of innovation. 
- as you know from wicked problems, the ability for a designer  to solve a problem is largely affected by their worldview. (their biases play a big part of how they approach and solve the problem). 
- i see an opportunity for the innovation space (the period in which you go from 'problems not worth solving' to a research brief) to create a method for tracking your assumptions as the designer. this will help you design more equitable solutions. the working title is the ""design ledger"""
6871,2021-04-02T16:57:05.991000+00:00,Is that what you're doing the thesis about as well?
6872,2021-04-02T16:50:10.030000+00:00,üëå
6873,2021-04-02T16:49:42.496000+00:00,Thanks !

6876,2021-04-02T16:48:43.282000+00:00,Basically business ecosystem design
6877,2021-04-02T16:48:34.459000+00:00,Yupp

6879,2021-04-02T16:47:07.543000+00:00,
6880,2021-04-02T16:46:24.396000+00:00,is that from your textbook?
6881,2021-04-02T16:45:27.154000+00:00,"yes, thats mad cool, thanks!"
6882,2021-04-02T16:44:52.413000+00:00,
6883,2021-04-02T16:44:07.189000+00:00,Also this may interest you
6884,2021-04-02T16:42:32.133000+00:00,yeah that must be really important
6885,2021-04-02T16:41:52.133000+00:00,Also a nice canvas for such a bief
6886,2021-04-02T16:39:42.463000+00:00,that sounds awesome!
6887,2021-04-02T16:39:27.557000+00:00,"She's designing a toolkit, to do co-design sessions together with CEO's, to concept business ideas with them togehter"
6888,2021-04-02T16:38:44.278000+00:00,"It's a service design company, aimed towards teaching businesses to ideate about making sustainable design"
6889,2021-04-02T16:38:10.852000+00:00,"Ahh yeah, one of my class mates does her grad project about that actually!"
6890,2021-04-02T16:36:46.160000+00:00,"I was thinking of how companies are transitioning to become more sustainable. innovation for these companies (they use a linear value chain instead of a circular one) is about how they can change their operations to make a profit with a different value chain. they may not need a new p/s, but instead need new structure"
6891,2021-04-02T16:33:36.982000+00:00,Can't think of a business model when there is no product yet
6892,2021-04-02T16:33:26.935000+00:00,"yeah, I guess that's much later in the stage though"
6893,2021-04-02T16:31:48.483000+00:00,"the outcome of a design brief is an idea (product/service), but in order to make a profit, you have to consider the business model and decide if it needs to be adjusted. 
- In this case, i think the design brief does not include business model innovation"
6894,2021-04-02T16:27:52.729000+00:00,Which component exactly?
6895,2021-04-02T16:23:05.993000+00:00,and then there's the whole business component which i feel design briefs don't address well either
6896,2021-04-02T16:20:21.171000+00:00,true
6897,2021-04-02T16:19:56.269000+00:00,It's a necessary evil I suppose
6898,2021-04-02T16:19:27.807000+00:00,yeah writing a good research/design brief is like a whole job in itself
6899,2021-04-02T16:17:11.496000+00:00,"But yeah, that's not the best way. Should plan more"
6900,2021-04-02T16:16:42.133000+00:00,Personally I'm not really a planner. So I prefer to use simpler approaches that take less time
6901,2021-04-02T16:16:16.878000+00:00,"Yeah, all the time."
6902,2021-04-02T16:13:33.472000+00:00,ive got a prototype framework i am finessing right now
6903,2021-04-02T16:12:39.382000+00:00,"yeah exactly, i feel like there are so many thing you gotta think about there"
6904,2021-04-02T16:12:37.610000+00:00,Are you doing research right now?
6905,2021-04-02T16:12:16.167000+00:00,I often just followed my nose üòÇ
6906,2021-04-02T16:12:14.096000+00:00,"nice! i feel like there are a lot of components to a good research brief, does it ever get too complex?"
6907,2021-04-02T16:12:08.811000+00:00,But in reality
6908,2021-04-02T16:07:57.236000+00:00,"So basically by debriefing, mapping out all assumptions made in the debrief, then frame them into research questions"
6909,2021-04-02T16:07:06.984000+00:00,
6910,2021-04-02T16:05:48.660000+00:00,One method I used was this:
6911,2021-04-02T16:05:19.074000+00:00,"Well sort of, everything kind of flowed out of the initial design statement"
6912,2021-04-02T15:59:33.873000+00:00,"yeah totally, research is quite a rigours process

did you have any methods for how you decided what to research"
6913,2021-04-02T15:58:52.354000+00:00,"Because you are human, thus are bound the ask leading question. And are bound to subconsciously make your own assumptions based on observation"
6914,2021-04-02T15:58:13.426000+00:00,It was basically a lesson about how research is always subjective when you analyse it
6915,2021-04-02T15:56:42.461000+00:00,ANd instead you research that
6916,2021-04-02T15:56:37.488000+00:00,"Then you inverse it: ""People like saving for money"""
6917,2021-04-02T15:56:19.972000+00:00,"Basically you find something in your research like: ""People dislike saving for money, because X and Y"""
6918,2021-04-02T15:55:51.312000+00:00,"cool, how does that work?"
6919,2021-04-02T15:55:33.302000+00:00,One technique we used was reversing insights
6920,2021-04-02T15:54:50.356000+00:00,I did a minor in innovation
6921,2021-04-02T15:54:42.490000+00:00,I did some things one that too in the past
6922,2021-04-02T15:54:28.779000+00:00,Oh nice!
6923,2021-04-02T15:53:11.032000+00:00,I'm looking at ways for designers to show and track their assumptions during the early stages of innovation
6924,2021-04-02T15:51:00.087000+00:00,What is your subject about?
6925,2021-04-02T15:49:51.283000+00:00,"I totally understand that, I'm writing my thesis now and my brain is all over the place üòÇ"
6926,2021-04-02T15:43:14.983000+00:00,The smaller case will definitely be more in a story setting
6927,2021-04-02T15:42:52.613000+00:00,"That would be nice yeah, so far it's mainly just a big documentation of decisions üòÇ"
6928,2021-04-02T15:39:49.555000+00:00,"sounds great, good luck! and yeah as you probably know, I'd just say the more you can tell your project in a story format the better üëçüèº"
6929,2021-04-02T15:36:42.864000+00:00,"Yup, already finished so far luckily. Now it's just a big case study (which is also mostly done, just finalizing visualizations)"
6930,2021-04-02T15:34:35.182000+00:00,"sweet, do you have idea ideas yet?"
6931,2021-04-02T15:33:51.960000+00:00,Then combining all these in a sensible end product
6932,2021-04-02T15:33:17.863000+00:00,"So a lot of research is about; mapping health belief about covid, WFHX, behavior in office, how to ethically influence this behavior and technology I suppose"
6933,2021-04-02T15:31:47.642000+00:00,"Using IoT in offices, to help employees safely collaborate in offices"
6934,2021-04-02T15:30:20.307000+00:00,what's your topic about?
6935,2021-04-02T15:29:39.073000+00:00,
6936,2021-04-02T15:28:25.686000+00:00,"other than that, I'd say trying to sketch out your thinking is great too. I just read this book, Draw to Win by Dan Roam, and he has a great way to explain complex information"
6937,2021-04-02T15:27:15.262000+00:00,It's a wicked problem yeah
6938,2021-04-02T15:27:12.149000+00:00,this might help contextualize where you research is
6939,2021-04-02T15:26:57.788000+00:00,"^ look under assignment 3, and towards the bottom with the example of the horse drawn carriage to the car"
6940,2021-04-02T15:25:48.616000+00:00,"looking good! I'm a big fan of CMU's MLP map, I think it does a really good job of communicating complex data. if you can label your high level thoughts through this, you can dive into more specific frameworks after 
https://transitiondesignseminarcmu.net/assignments/"
6941,2021-04-02T15:24:47.871000+00:00,Seems like a nice software
6942,2021-04-02T15:24:41.722000+00:00,Just bought https://creately.com/ though
6943,2021-04-02T15:20:30.671000+00:00,So way to chaotic to communicate
6944,2021-04-02T15:20:24.285000+00:00,
6945,2021-04-02T15:20:22.429000+00:00,Currently it's spread all over the place I suppose
6946,2021-04-02T15:19:46.309000+00:00,"Yeah, I suppose mostly tons of user interviews!"
6947,2021-04-02T15:18:03.051000+00:00,"where is your data from? like user interviews, literature review, or something"
6948,2021-04-02T15:17:10.280000+00:00,I guess more showing the insights in general!
6949,2021-04-02T15:16:22.820000+00:00,how would you like to visualize the research you have?
6950,2021-04-02T15:15:17.450000+00:00,That;s more for product market fit though
6951,2021-04-02T15:14:32.103000+00:00,
6952,2021-04-02T15:14:30.397000+00:00,YEah already made some of these
6953,2021-04-02T15:13:06.406000+00:00,I use this framework a lot for visualizing primary research
6954,2021-04-02T15:12:28.231000+00:00,https://www.strategyzer.com/books/value-proposition-design
6955,2021-04-02T15:11:10.190000+00:00,Frameworks?
6956,2021-04-02T15:10:49.914000+00:00,are you using any frameworks now?
6957,2021-04-02T10:10:58.991000+00:00,Anyone got some sources how they visualize their UX research? (Qualitative)
6958,2021-04-01T17:39:17.064000+00:00,<:ThinkEyes1:711813052433039370>  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvq4whZNFXI
6959,2021-04-01T08:49:15.351000+00:00,That's actually a really cool way of viewing the compartmentalization! Priming with the Physical does make sense. Just being intentional on the movements and nothing else can be extremely meditative.
6960,2021-04-01T06:40:52.958000+00:00,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snAhsXyO3Ck&ab_channel=CGPGrey
6961,2021-04-01T06:40:36.806000+00:00,"That's a nice one yeah! Variety of environment sort of tries to capture that. I think that's especially noticeable in the growing need of flex work places

I saw a video once about this subject. Comparing the quarantine to living in a little space ship"
6962,2021-04-01T05:34:01.218000+00:00,"What about being able to have a separate space from the home environment? I know you already have ""variety of envrionment"" but I interpreted that as there are multiple environments within a single office space, as opposed to a desk in your own house. I know for me, I miss stepping into the building and knowing I was arriving ready to work and being able to have that distinct separation of work life and home life."
6963,2021-03-31T06:24:50.740000+00:00,"A lot of people are actually already doing a ""commute"" they go for a walk outside, before they get back home to work."
6964,2021-03-31T00:17:20.150000+00:00,Approximate tasks and physical conditions of your normal commute.
6965,2021-03-30T23:26:12.897000+00:00,"What do you think a digital ""commute"" like that would entail?"
6966,2021-03-30T23:26:03.259000+00:00,I find that a really interesting idea
6967,2021-03-30T18:07:39.764000+00:00,"I think when people are in close proximity, it removes the barriers to communicate and also increases the frequency and comfort level of interactions. I think it is underrated how much effect frequency of interaction helps people interact more comfortably. Also with zoom, it is an instant interaction and no buildup that your mind is used to. I think the anxiety would be like if your coworkers just appeared in your house to discuss work stuff. I hypothesize that people would be more comfortable in zoom calls if they did a ""commute"" that resembles their previous commute in the morning."
6968,2021-03-29T06:59:20.364000+00:00,"Do you guys recognize this, feel something is missing, or maybe disagree with some things?"
6969,2021-03-29T06:58:58.752000+00:00,"The need in the middle, then spreading out the reasons, sort off"
6970,2021-03-29T06:58:24.710000+00:00,
6971,2021-03-29T06:58:18.942000+00:00,This is a raw sketch of some insights
6972,2021-03-29T06:58:04.530000+00:00,"I've researched how covid influenced companies, the effect of not collaborating face to face"
6973,2021-03-29T06:56:39.587000+00:00,I'd like some of your opinion
6974,2021-03-29T06:20:18.064000+00:00,I should ask her the name of the book
6975,2021-03-29T06:19:13.109000+00:00,"My girlfriend just started her master. She got one book about stats, it starts at the very basic getting a little more complex each chapter."

6993,2021-03-28T18:40:25.444000+00:00,Yeah definitely!
6994,2021-03-28T18:32:55.108000+00:00,Ooh then maybe I should take a more advanced stat class where they use R lol
6995,2021-03-28T18:20:38.532000+00:00,"But if you're good at that, then doing R or Python is definitely a big plus!"

The org won't let us invest time in testing this due to deadline issues, however on further discussions we did find Situation B to perform better.

However changes like stating the purpose of the action at the start in situation A, or reframing it from emoji to upvote/downvote concept with proper onboarding can making situation A work as good as situation B
~
However the org has decided to go ahead with situation A as it's something they had thought about initially and kinda feel that if it works then it's okay.. they don't need to do situation B. 


In conclusion however, more physical interaction might not always be a bad experience, it could infact improve and make the user feel more confident of their actions, so situation B would have been better than situation A."

7048,2021-03-24T10:07:06.063000+00:00,But is kind of terrible to actually design behaviour change
7049,2021-03-24T10:06:49.431000+00:00,Like the Fogg model attempts to explain behaviour change / nudges
7050,2021-03-24T10:06:24.829000+00:00,"Yeah, I found that a lot of the models used for analyzing aren't necessarily good for practical use"
7051,2021-03-24T09:10:29.882000+00:00,The aim is to prioritize the reduction of perceived interaction costs rather than actual interaction costs
7052,2021-03-24T09:06:17.688000+00:00,I agree. Either surveys or interviews to check for motivation and perceived costs in conjunction with the numbers would be better.
7053,2021-03-24T09:02:54.649000+00:00,Motivation is too qualitative
7054,2021-03-24T09:01:06.119000+00:00,So be careful numbers don't dumb it down instead
7055,2021-03-24T09:00:49.763000+00:00,It's not a beta science though

7061,2021-03-24T08:27:45.558000+00:00,Yea üòÇ that's why I was wondering if there was a metric or numeric value attached.. it would have made things easier.. so was wondering if there was a way to calculate it
7062,2021-03-24T08:27:39.292000+00:00,I hope that helped clarify! üôÇ
7063,2021-03-24T08:26:56.498000+00:00,So A might win over B in some cases and B will win over A in some cases. Because complexity of the decision will act as a moderator
7064,2021-03-24T08:26:05.572000+00:00,I meant. Complexity serves as a moderator
7065,2021-03-24T08:25:50.037000+00:00,"Ah, I see the miscommunication now"

as for Tesler's law <@456226577798135808> : the reason it would be considered same is because, in situation A they have to select an emoji .. in situation B too they have to select an emoji but more context about the outcomes of the emoji is presented.. as per Tesler's law, the concept of selecting the emoji to make a decision would remain same for both.. that's the sort of complexity which cannot be removed so I'm considering it to be 0"
7067,2021-03-24T08:24:20.557000+00:00,"because if the perceived costs are higher, motivation might increase"
7068,2021-03-24T08:21:35.393000+00:00,The type of interaction might inform motivation

7078,2021-03-24T08:19:22.049000+00:00,I was just about to respond about motivation
7079,2021-03-24T08:19:01.477000+00:00,"So i did some research on this too, as per articles I read, the motivation could vary a lot on perceived value of the brand. Like if Apple has  a complex step but you are an apple fanboy, you would still go through the complex step because you are extrinsically motivated to do so.

Luckily in this case motivation might not be a factor since the end goal and result of situation A and B are the same.. so even if there is motivation, as they are in the same product, in the same location, the motivation could be considered 0 in the calculation"
7080,2021-03-24T08:17:02.816000+00:00,It's basically about interaction cost as well
7081,2021-03-24T08:16:47.595000+00:00,
7082,2021-03-24T08:16:45.565000+00:00,But seems to fit

7084,2021-03-24T08:16:13.393000+00:00,How valuable the action personally and the interaction cost
7085,2021-03-24T08:14:19.280000+00:00,I think you can apply motivation theories to that as well
7086,2021-03-24T07:43:06.596000+00:00,"I'll try doing some qualitative study on this to better understand what the participants feel. 

""I think the interaction cost for each would depend on the specific decision to be made and its complexity. "" -> we can assume this to be zero as as the decision and complexity is same for both considering Tesler's Law

""Additionally, the time taken for the interaction in each situation would also function as another extraneous variable"" -> this as per Fitt's law would be advantageous for Situation A if time is considered but in terms of accuracy, this is advantageous for Situation B

Considering Miller's Law, there will be a need for short term working memory as situation B opens a modal, which causes distraction from the current thinking and then the user needs to remember what the current feedback is to select the emoji -> So Situation A has the advantage

But thanks for your opinion üôÇ I think doing a test would better help determine the outcome."
7087,2021-03-24T07:04:22.320000+00:00,"This is such an interesting question! I am not sure of what is typical in the field (I am *very* new to UX) but am approaching this question as someone in cognitive psych. I think the interaction cost for each would depend on the specific decision to be made and its complexity. Additionally, the time taken for the interaction in each situation would also function as another extraneous variable. Quantitatively, I would determine weightage by comparing time taken to make the interaction, accuracy (gauged by a post-test), and answers on Likert style survey questions. Qualitatively, I would ask participants to describe their experience making the decisions and then compare those data to see which ones participants had less of an issue with."
7088,2021-03-24T05:51:24.024000+00:00,"Curious about interaction cost calculation

Consider 
situation A: particular interaction takes a single click (Physical Interaction cost) but then the user has to think a lot before clicking it (Mental Interaction Cost)
situation B: particular interaction takes 3 clicks but then the user has to think very less comparatively before clicking it

would situation A = B ? and how would one calculate Physical vs Mental weightage?

the nngroup had an article on the same but did not explain how would once assume weightage : https://www.nngroup.com/articles/interaction-cost-definition/

~
Real life example:
Situation A -> selecting an emoji directly to give feedback (but it cannot be changed later even if it was an accidental click)
Situation B -> opening feedback module, selecting the emoji and pressing confirm"

In the reporting, the design process is messy, so that there does not seem to be an overview. Although use is made of the Double Diamond, the design in this process lacks the targeted system that underlies it. Different iterations are done on the HMW and different methods are applied, but these seem to arise incoherently and randomly instead of deriving causally (logically) from the different insights gained during the process. Although the presentation had more overview (compared to the report), more coherence should also be added here. Try to bring forward the rationale (substantiation of your choices and how this gives direction to your process) even more clearly, so that coherence and overview are created.

Although several iterations of the concept have been delivered, there is currently still a lack of refinement in the development of the product. Try to make a clear link with the different principles (values ‚Äã‚Äã/ needs) and how you translate these into the final product. In addition, the report is currently very textual, make more use of information and process visualisations. In addition, during the session it was questioned how the product can be implemented at the client. Elaborate this 'implementation plan' by, for example, working with business model canvas and value proposition canvas.

7109,2021-03-18T18:26:47.563000+00:00,I guess with a concept test you need to test 'problem' scenarios
7110,2021-03-18T18:24:37.175000+00:00,Concept testing you're testing whether what you make is actually something people want / solves a specific problem

7113,2021-03-18T07:54:22.417000+00:00,I guess some difference is concept testing instead of usability testing

7121,2021-03-17T15:50:17.350000+00:00,"but kind of seriously, I use contrast and thats about it. Simulations of things is much less valuable than watching people use your product."
7122,2021-03-17T15:49:00.325000+00:00,üòâ and everyone is a usability tool if you make them care about usability üòâ üòâ
7123,2021-03-17T15:41:48.434000+00:00,"What do you mean by ""the same""?"
7124,2021-03-17T10:54:55.931000+00:00,"and other related but unrelated question is, which usability tools do you guys use at your company?"
7125,2021-03-17T10:54:11.592000+00:00,"hey guys, is conducting usability test for hardware and software the same?"
7126,2021-03-17T05:16:10.871000+00:00,we send the customer team all our queries and they interact with the clients and gather feedback
7127,2021-03-17T05:15:52.614000+00:00,In my case we rely on existing customers to gather feedback instead of looking for new ones.. the product is B2B and the customer / sales team have a good rapport with the clients unlike the design team.. so we rely on them to do the communication for us
7128,2021-03-17T04:54:50.822000+00:00,"What's your current process in engaging with and finding those types of users? I have a similar problem in my capstone project where the users are literally 1 in 15 million (some like 400 total of them on Earth ü§£), so we end up trying to assess the criteria that make those users unique, that's relevant to the problem space and tasks at hand, and then search for analogous/similar users elsewhere."
7129,2021-03-16T09:48:59.442000+00:00,let's see though.. we have spoken to the customer success team.. so in next quarter they said they will be taking this up and accordingly have also brought in VP of product and engineering to make this process more smoother
7130,2021-03-16T09:47:55.524000+00:00,the minimum price per month is around 10k dollars
7131,2021-03-16T09:47:47.261000+00:00,Hierarchy issues again
7132,2021-03-16T09:47:37.298000+00:00,They're usually easier to approach üòÇ
7133,2021-03-16T09:47:30.348000+00:00,Ahh yeah
7134,2021-03-16T09:47:25.251000+00:00,üòÇ  they can't afford the product
7135,2021-03-16T09:46:55.725000+00:00,So small companies
7136,2021-03-16T09:46:37.268000+00:00,"Well, could it be companies that have like 10 people?"
7137,2021-03-16T09:46:03.734000+00:00,when you say big business.. what would that mean?
7138,2021-03-16T09:45:51.115000+00:00,"So the user is CEO, CHRO and the CXOs ... however the communication sort of happens through their subordinates"
7139,2021-03-16T09:43:42.327000+00:00,Can it just be CEO of big business?
7140,2021-03-16T09:42:33.571000+00:00,yes .. that's why they don't get time.. so our customer success team talks to them whenever they are launching something new or if the CEOs schedule a meeting
7141,2021-03-16T09:41:46.684000+00:00,Weren't your end-users CEO's?
7142,2021-03-16T09:41:37.356000+00:00,"Wasn't allowed to directly contact, but my PM was always ready to introduce me to anyone when I had a good reason"
7143,2021-03-16T09:41:10.894000+00:00,and your actual end-users.. like in my case they are just too busy to contribute
7144,2021-03-16T09:38:28.208000+00:00,I guess it comes down to how hierarchical the company culture is.
7145,2021-03-16T09:34:10.235000+00:00,"Actually same here, also big company and B2B. Even I as intern was allowed to speak to the actual end-users."
7146,2021-03-15T23:06:33.401000+00:00,"Company size matters. As I design for mostly enterprise customers, I am very removed from the actual end-users. I rely on my research peers and product managers to connect."
7147,2021-03-12T10:21:04.304000+00:00,So maybe not being able to talk to costumers at companies is more of US company culture thing than a industry culture.
7148,2021-03-12T10:01:59.245000+00:00,üá™üá∫
7149,2021-03-12T09:59:46.347000+00:00,But that's like 50 years ago maybe
7150,2021-03-12T09:57:36.101000+00:00,"`Participatory design was actually born in Scandinavia and called cooperative design. However, when the methods were presented to the US community 'cooperation' was a word that didn't resonate with the strong separation between workers and managers - they weren't supposed to discuss ways of working face-to-face. Hence, 'participatory' was instead used as the initial Participatory Design sessions weren't a direct cooperation between workers and managers, sitting in the same room discussing how to improve their work environment and tools, but there were separate sessions for workers and managers. Each group was participating in the process, not directly cooperating. (in historical review of Cooperative Design, at a Scandinavian conference).` 

üòÇ"
7151,2021-03-12T09:57:29.253000+00:00,Actually some history about that
7152,2021-03-12T09:55:52.406000+00:00,User-centric design too socialistic üòÇ
7153,2021-03-12T09:55:44.167000+00:00,Might be a Europe thing
7154,2021-03-12T09:52:16.237000+00:00,same in UK at least where i work!
7155,2021-03-12T08:22:47.482000+00:00,Maybe I'm making the assumption that a design should always be a new product
7156,2021-03-12T08:19:18.952000+00:00,But I guess that's just arguing definitions rather than 'what is effective design'
7157,2021-03-12T08:01:30.332000+00:00,"I guess the point is if you're not doing a User-Focused Design style, you're not doing UX design"
7158,2021-03-11T19:42:01.378000+00:00,interesting... i guess... <:ThinkEyes1:711813052433039370>
7159,2021-03-11T19:38:00.907000+00:00,"https://articles.uie.com/five_design_decision_styles/#:~:text=In%20the%20course%20of%20our,team%20employs%20to%20make%20decisions."
7160,2021-03-11T19:36:10.904000+00:00,what are the five types of design decisions?
7161,2021-03-11T16:45:56.480000+00:00,"The other has no solution yet, so there's nothing to incrementally improve. Only a vague problem that isn't defined yet. Like Covid-19, it's just a dark spot that needs a solution that can't be defined because no concrete data exists."
7162,2021-03-11T16:44:25.662000+00:00,One got a goal to incrementally design a product to be more usable/valuable
7163,2021-03-11T16:43:08.043000+00:00,"I guess maybe that's a big difference if you work as UX designer at Discord, FaceBook, IG, TIKTOK, whatever vs an agency too"
7164,2021-03-11T16:35:23.516000+00:00,It's used by the big tech companies because their product already exists
7165,2021-03-11T16:34:32.480000+00:00,But always incremental
7166,2021-03-11T16:34:29.177000+00:00,Yeah it's valid
7167,2021-03-11T16:33:14.594000+00:00,Designing products compared to designing concepts
7168,2021-03-11T16:32:47.722000+00:00,Not innovations
7169,2021-03-11T16:32:43.044000+00:00,Optimizations
7170,2021-03-11T16:32:19.151000+00:00,Especially general interaction design
7171,2021-03-11T16:32:16.598000+00:00,"and its an entirely valid way to make design decisions, used by many of the biggest tech companies that we talk about all the time."
7172,2021-03-11T16:32:11.588000+00:00,"Yeah true, it's not a bad style for certain contexts either"
7173,2021-03-11T16:31:42.067000+00:00,its one of the five types* of design decisions
7174,2021-03-11T16:31:14.501000+00:00,Of some non existing universal idea of experience
7175,2021-03-11T16:31:03.660000+00:00,The idea that the experts know what the user wants
7176,2021-03-11T16:30:23.708000+00:00,This is literally the opposite
7177,2021-03-11T16:27:02.831000+00:00,Actually CX position though
7178,2021-03-11T16:26:33.818000+00:00,This specific project
7179,2021-03-11T16:26:31.097000+00:00,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4lsX-Saw-Y&ab_channel=Mirabeau%2CACognizantDigitalBusiness
7180,2021-03-11T16:25:12.129000+00:00,Project for a dashboard for KLM plane engineers
7181,2021-03-11T16:24:52.842000+00:00,To learn how they work and what their challenges are
7182,2021-03-11T16:24:45.386000+00:00,When at a KLM project at my last position they literally spent the entire day together with the engineers
7183,2021-03-11T16:24:00.152000+00:00,User shadowing in public spaces pretty common
7184,2021-03-11T16:23:50.144000+00:00,"Not sure how that is in the US, but here in the Netherlands you definitely talk to the users"
7185,2021-03-11T16:23:42.070000+00:00,<a:PeepoSweat:772358641679597588>
7186,2021-03-11T16:23:06.575000+00:00,Isn't it literally defined as a user-centric process?
7187,2021-03-11T16:22:26.920000+00:00,How can it really be a UX position then?
7188,2021-03-11T16:21:45.171000+00:00,which are built on the knowledge of an entire industry
7189,2021-03-11T16:20:37.932000+00:00,The role of a UX expert isn't valuable because that person knows how to talk to customers. It has value because that person has knowledge of and experience applying best industry practices.
7190,2021-03-11T16:20:31.883000+00:00,"Yeah the initial question was how to do UX design without user input, or if possible to do without direct user input"
7191,2021-03-11T16:17:25.240000+00:00,"Many large companies dont let their UX designers interact with customers directly for the most part, with maybe the exception of large, well planned and structured events."
7192,2021-03-11T16:16:52.685000+00:00,"I'm late to the convo, but the idea that UX design is user centric, or that UX roles revolve around generating user research is one of the big myths of the UX Design industry."
7193,2021-03-11T15:48:09.277000+00:00,"Aight, I'll leave you to it! üòÇ"
7194,2021-03-11T15:47:41.375000+00:00,So I guess what you're tyring to say is that two ideas meet from different teams and the balance might not always be agreed upon?
7195,2021-03-11T15:45:59.194000+00:00,"I need to actually do work tho, have a lot on my plate now that this meeting has wrapped up üëÄ"
7196,2021-03-11T15:45:18.046000+00:00,That technology isn't always helpful the same way
7197,2021-03-11T15:45:09.209000+00:00,But that clean overlap doesn't always exist
7198,2021-03-11T15:43:46.537000+00:00,And finding those  s y n e r g i e s  is important
7199,2021-03-11T15:43:27.199000+00:00,Lol I definitely think Cognizant has a better process
7200,2021-03-11T15:43:25.099000+00:00,Where two sides of a coin meet
7201,2021-03-11T15:43:19.965000+00:00,"So yeah, sort of going up in the food chain"
7202,2021-03-11T15:42:58.306000+00:00,Then they get the technology and they run a pilot
7203,2021-03-11T15:42:37.997000+00:00,Then people in the netherlands had a specific idea that happens to work well with that technology
7204,2021-03-11T15:42:20.104000+00:00,People in india got this cool technology
7205,2021-03-11T15:42:19.776000+00:00,"Well at least that's the business pitch for our work, in my opinion."
7206,2021-03-11T15:42:11.849000+00:00,I guess at cognizant it was more like
7207,2021-03-11T15:42:05.746000+00:00,"Ahh yes, I suppose that's true"
7208,2021-03-11T15:42:03.116000+00:00,Not my current company <:lmoa:697917150131781705>
7209,2021-03-11T15:41:49.714000+00:00,We as in designers
7210,2021-03-11T15:41:43.283000+00:00,We as in your current company?
7211,2021-03-11T15:41:23.455000+00:00,"Which is why we try to insist on the discovery first process, because then the company hasn't invested so much capital in the solution yet."
7212,2021-03-11T15:41:20.200000+00:00,Then they can put 10 people just on qualitative research
7213,2021-03-11T15:40:55.613000+00:00,"To be able to say as agency ""THis is not the right problem"""
7214,2021-03-11T15:40:53.732000+00:00,Well yeah you need to sell the idea up the food chain
7215,2021-03-11T15:40:46.082000+00:00,Cognizant bought agencies to do that for them
7216,2021-03-11T15:40:39.988000+00:00,Depends the weight you carry
7217,2021-03-11T15:40:23.915000+00:00,"But when you say ""well your solution you already invested in isn't the best"" the company doesn't just re-orient because you said that."
7218,2021-03-11T15:39:55.573000+00:00,And buying up companies specialized in that
7219,2021-03-11T15:39:47.052000+00:00,Cognizant seems to be heavily investing in data scientist currently
7220,2021-03-11T15:39:25.527000+00:00,"Same as being given the problem space of ""interior sensing"""
7221,2021-03-11T15:39:14.605000+00:00,But it makes you approach the problem from a certain perspective
7222,2021-03-11T15:39:00.669000+00:00,"And being given a large problem space like ""smart office"" isn't completely prescriptive"
7223,2021-03-11T15:38:35.225000+00:00,And I think trying to maintain those agency structures as separate offshoots to try to preserve that structure a little.
7224,2021-03-11T15:38:09.688000+00:00,Yup hahah
7225,2021-03-11T15:38:04.259000+00:00,Like Cognizant üôÇ
7226,2021-03-11T15:37:51.838000+00:00,But companies are buying and integrating agencies now üëÄ
7227,2021-03-11T15:37:36.671000+00:00,Lol yeah
7228,2021-03-11T15:37:15.069000+00:00,Or hire an agency to do it for you
7229,2021-03-11T15:36:32.801000+00:00,Are we going to turn the story in a movie or in a book or so to speak
7230,2021-03-11T15:36:23.073000+00:00,"Yeah if you have enough capital to run a dual-pronged organization, and split production and innovation into separate pipelines."
7231,2021-03-11T15:36:21.871000+00:00,User Research > problem defining > Concept > then look what technology supports this the best
7232,2021-03-11T15:35:49.663000+00:00,So I guess in that sense it can be nice to do
7233,2021-03-11T15:35:41.615000+00:00,Though many companies learned that a user centric approach (sadly not all) will be more money in the long run
7234,2021-03-11T15:33:43.586000+00:00,"And a new IP is not the same as a useful, user friendly product."
7235,2021-03-11T15:33:26.182000+00:00,But company valuation is driven by IP
7236,2021-03-11T15:33:08.330000+00:00,Same with some teams in Apple I'm sure.
7237,2021-03-11T15:32:58.387000+00:00,Because of the huge amount of money Google has to invest
7238,2021-03-11T15:32:47.976000+00:00,Yeah I think the point is in some regard they are insulated from 'the stock market' so to speak
7239,2021-03-11T15:32:08.321000+00:00,All technology center
7240,2021-03-11T15:32:03.264000+00:00,"Yes, I've been learning about patents lately and that process and what they really are, and that's how I found what drives this divide in process."
7241,2021-03-11T15:32:00.894000+00:00,I mean it's the whole idea of Google X even
7242,2021-03-11T15:31:12.944000+00:00,"And I think what I've observed is this split between what drives company valuation, and what makes a ""good product"""
7243,2021-03-11T15:31:12.207000+00:00,"We have ""Smart office"" find out what you can do with it"
7244,2021-03-11T15:30:57.969000+00:00,Partly this was also said to me
7245,2021-03-11T15:30:21.808000+00:00,"Yeah, most big IT companies work like that too"
7246,2021-03-11T15:30:20.274000+00:00,Even though say it only makes a good solution 15% of the time vs 33% of the time from a problem discovery process.
7247,2021-03-11T15:29:58.858000+00:00,"But good things can still come out of it, is I think my point."
7248,2021-03-11T15:29:45.964000+00:00,Which is not great.
7249,2021-03-11T15:29:18.392000+00:00,"A lot of what I do is driven by ""well our engineers made a system that does X, now figure out what to actually do with it"""
7250,2021-03-11T15:28:51.005000+00:00,For sure!
7251,2021-03-11T15:28:33.164000+00:00,So I might be framed into thinking like that too
7252,2021-03-11T15:28:31.052000+00:00,"But it is something that happens, and it happens in a lot of places, and you still need to be able to operate within that if required."
7253,2021-03-11T15:28:26.194000+00:00,"Yeah, I currently literally do my project for the 'innovation lab'"
7254,2021-03-11T15:27:52.203000+00:00,"Sure, and I would definitely say I have a lot of problems with solutions-driven ""innovation"" (which is what my company wants) and I think it leads to a lot of wasted effort and dead-ends."
7255,2021-03-11T15:27:16.500000+00:00,In innovation you spend 90% defining the problem
7256,2021-03-11T15:26:49.129000+00:00,But not the cause
7257,2021-03-11T15:26:46.273000+00:00,"Or well, the problem is known, the existence"
7258,2021-03-11T15:26:28.337000+00:00,Otherwise the innovation would probably already be here
7259,2021-03-11T15:26:14.374000+00:00,For any innovation the problem is not known
7260,2021-03-11T15:26:07.862000+00:00,I think the key is also `necessary for the problem you are trying to solve`
7261,2021-03-11T15:25:44.921000+00:00,I definitely agree with that indeed.
7262,2021-03-11T15:24:31.825000+00:00,"This might be dumbing it down in some way but it's a split between innovation and production imo, and production driven or engineering driven design isn't a horrible sin. It's just a realistic constraint in some workplaces and some scopes of work."
7263,2021-03-11T15:23:06.818000+00:00,"But I would just say that there's a lot of privilege in being to do deep explorative research, and explore solutions more widely. That's not always realistically in scope, and not always necessary for the problem you are trying to solve."
7264,2021-03-11T15:21:33.627000+00:00,"Sorry to leave you talking to yourself, I was in a meeting and had to actually contribute for a bit"
7265,2021-03-11T15:06:49.516000+00:00,"Kind of, the problem is not understood until after the formulation of a solution."
7266,2021-03-11T15:03:13.340000+00:00,It had a specific name...
7267,2021-03-11T15:02:12.919000+00:00,"Research in the dark, sort of üï∂Ô∏è"
7268,2021-03-11T15:00:28.194000+00:00,I guess that's a big difference in science and design research too
7269,2021-03-11T14:56:52.232000+00:00,While explorative or generative will be the type of research to support that
7270,2021-03-11T14:56:30.646000+00:00,The weak thing about an hypothesis is that you already assume you know where to look
7271,2021-03-11T14:56:02.957000+00:00,"Yeah, it's still effective way to research I suppose. But when the hypothesis has already been discovered."
7272,2021-03-11T14:55:21.582000+00:00,So going in the research without actually making a hypothesis can be very effective
7273,2021-03-11T14:54:29.594000+00:00,"Lets say, from my background, I have no idea how to run formal research, but do know how to write an analysis paper, so that's what I did my best to do. xD"
7274,2021-03-11T14:54:08.077000+00:00,You suddenly find out they have a big love for seaguls
7275,2021-03-11T14:53:58.017000+00:00,"A bit like, by observing whales"
7276,2021-03-11T14:53:46.554000+00:00,Definitely üôÇ
7277,2021-03-11T14:53:28.755000+00:00,Yeah but it's descriptive not explorative
7278,2021-03-11T14:52:50.706000+00:00,Meta analysis is a legitimate form of research and insight discovery.
7279,2021-03-11T14:52:11.560000+00:00,"Although I disagree that you can't discover anything new from secondary research, but it will be very incremental."
7280,2021-03-11T14:51:18.342000+00:00,Design has been done like that fine for a long time
7281,2021-03-11T14:51:18.005000+00:00,There are things you can do that are *better than nothing* lol
7282,2021-03-11T14:51:09.957000+00:00,Yeah I definitely agree though
7283,2021-03-11T14:51:05.593000+00:00,"As in, the most valuable information is often that what you weren't even looking for"
7284,2021-03-11T14:50:50.564000+00:00,It's just an answer to the question lol
7285,2021-03-11T14:50:35.429000+00:00,Oh I 100% agree
7286,2021-03-11T14:50:11.203000+00:00,I guess the main weakness is that method is that you don't discover anything new
7287,2021-03-11T14:46:19.277000+00:00,Research papers on interaction would be more HCI focused then
7288,2021-03-11T14:44:27.207000+00:00,More like business centric design then
7289,2021-03-11T14:44:20.956000+00:00,It just doesn't fit the definition of user centric design
7290,2021-03-11T14:44:05.677000+00:00,I guess that's what I mean with you can still design something without having to do user research
7291,2021-03-11T13:54:33.811000+00:00,"My opinion has generally been that I use secondary research to create a hypothesis or initial prototype, and then believe in pushing to directly test that proposed solution."
7292,2021-03-11T13:53:27.389000+00:00,"Thank you for your comment Ben! I guess there are many alternative ways to get data from users, it's just not convenient as interviewing people officially"
7293,2021-03-11T13:51:05.899000+00:00,"Oh and I honestly like to just have casual conversations with people, when I'm chatting with family and friends, or even with cashiers or people in line. But I also work on a product that's well known publicly and that people have strong opinions on in general."
7294,2021-03-11T13:49:47.427000+00:00,I do think they can be somewhat more realistic to business pressures xD
7295,2021-03-11T13:49:16.961000+00:00,Are these the best ways to do UX? I would definitely not claim they are.
7296,2021-03-11T13:49:03.044000+00:00,"I definitely want to hop in here as a designer at a company that views talking to users as a luxury if not completely unnecessary, there are things you can do to derive insights as best you can. Generally what I've done to try to try to capture the voice of the user is firstly searching for existing white papers and research studies on user interaction, there is a lot of content out there, you just have to find it to get qualitative data or essentially piggy back on someone else's analysis. Also for more quantitative research I've often gone to forums, youtube reviews, and other places that users might be expressing themselves, and in some ways expressing themselves more freely because they're really just complaining."
7297,2021-03-11T13:31:58.645000+00:00,Architects are a good example üòÇ
7298,2021-03-11T13:29:56.963000+00:00,Yeah doesn't mean you can't design something good without talking to users though
7299,2021-03-11T13:29:14.790000+00:00,üëå
7300,2021-03-11T12:36:34.580000+00:00,got it. Thank you Dario!
7301,2021-03-11T11:44:46.004000+00:00,"But yes, it can't be user centered if you don't talk to actual users"
7302,2021-03-11T11:35:03.641000+00:00,But it's always going to be an assumption that it works in your context
7303,2021-03-11T11:34:44.123000+00:00,I guess you can do project based on just secondary research
7304,2021-03-11T11:34:03.133000+00:00,"It's why they call UX ""Wicked Problems"""
7305,2021-03-11T11:31:40.964000+00:00,Groups like NNgroup sell their conclusions about certain UX topics
7306,2021-03-11T11:30:30.397000+00:00,"Well I guess you can still use peoples conclusions. For raw data I figure people sell that for money. But even then because of the nature of qualitative data, it's too contextual. So depends what project you're doing."
7307,2021-03-11T11:25:34.371000+00:00,"So basically nothing ready to use both quantitative and qualitative research data. So basically it's not possible to practice ux design without interviewing people to get the data, right?"

7328,2021-03-10T20:27:11.028000+00:00,Thanks guys.
7329,2021-03-10T20:20:36.622000+00:00,"off please, the focus should be between the one leading the interview and the participant"
7330,2021-03-10T20:19:59.700000+00:00,Honestly I'd rather they had it turned off. I interview really well. But underneath the surface I'm anxious as all hell. I feel like someone taking notes to the side might throw me off my game. Out of sight out of mind feel me.
7331,2021-03-10T18:38:02.218000+00:00,"For online user interviews with a notetaker/observer, do you guys prefer them to have their webcams on or off? Thanks."

My tidbit of advice is to at least structure very similarly to other portfolio pieces: show your process, show the work you did and its impact, plenty of visuals and make it super readable and skimmable. Presenting the code itself isn't necessary unless you are doing something really innovative in the methods - just like i won't be showing my interview guides or surveys, rather broad research questions and the insights coming from them. Hope that helps a lil"

7349,2021-03-09T07:55:15.724000+00:00,But usually UX research is the least likely to get involved with coding

7354,2021-03-09T05:38:19.118000+00:00,isn't SQL and R for data analysts?

Currently I‚Äôm not working on any real projects so i don‚Äôt have any to put in a case study

Has anyone put together a research portfolio with either analysis using sql, r or otherwise? Curious what that could/might look liken"
7356,2021-03-07T14:20:52.811000+00:00,You could look into laddering interviews or cultural probes
7357,2021-03-07T14:20:20.379000+00:00,Since you say you want to 'reward' the user you probably need to do qualitative research
7358,2021-03-07T14:19:52.481000+00:00,"I'd avoid surveys. Surveys are a bad type of research, unless you have the channels to get huge amounts of answers, and even then you can only collect quantitative which is usually just closed ended questions (which isn't very good for getting to the core of the problem)"
7359,2021-03-07T11:11:41.588000+00:00,"Perfect ! Thank you , it helped me a lot to understand now üôÇ"
7360,2021-03-07T07:53:34.021000+00:00,"Hi Samir. As per my experience, the first step is to design a user interview protocol. You'd need to define the demographics of your target user in addition to other information specific to your project (for example, how tech-literate should they be?).
Following that, you approach users either face-to-face by visiting them in context (where they typically performing the task you're trying to enhance), or online via facebook groups, instagram posts etc. It's also helpful to visit people through a referral.
To convince them, you can begin by introducing yourself, asking them a couple of generic questions and trying to make them feel comfortable. You then move onto discussing how they perform the task you're trying to enhance. Don't mention the solution and don't ask them for a solution, at least not in the beginning. The point of conducting initial interviews is to understand how they perform a particular task and what challenges they face.
In some cases, you may have to incentivize users with benefits such as a small mutually-agreed amount.

Hope this answers your question to some degree."

Is it worth taking UX designer roles in the short term (if I‚Äôm lucky enough to land one in the first place) or should I focus on only research roles?

7379,2021-03-04T06:54:42.955000+00:00,"This has probably been asked already but is there a giant thread, megalist or notion of some sort for all UX Research things?"
7380,2021-03-04T02:52:30.462000+00:00,You might wanna just ask the question openly. Chances of someone otherwise replying would be very low.
7381,2021-03-04T01:25:08.488000+00:00,Does anyone here have experience joining an existing product as the first UX researcher? I'd love to ask you a few questions
7382,2021-03-02T10:35:27.407000+00:00,Laddering is more the technique to 'uncover' or to analyse them
7383,2021-03-02T10:35:12.252000+00:00,Is about latent needs
7384,2021-03-02T10:35:07.673000+00:00,https://www.researchgate.net/publication/271231569_An_Overview_of_the_Schwartz_Theory_of_Basic_Values
7385,2021-03-02T10:35:06.935000+00:00,Specifically this theory
7386,2021-03-02T10:33:36.771000+00:00,Cool üôÇ I'll read more on laddering
7387,2021-03-02T10:08:31.501000+00:00,It's also one of the weak points of laddering
7388,2021-03-02T10:08:18.930000+00:00,maybe ü§î we should do more of this sometimes
7389,2021-03-02T10:07:41.573000+00:00,"But maybe if I were in the same room, it would be easier"
7390,2021-03-02T10:07:19.839000+00:00,That's kind of the point of qualitative research
7391,2021-03-02T10:07:12.154000+00:00,ü§î probably
7392,2021-03-02T10:06:30.070000+00:00,Probably you don't know either
7393,2021-03-02T10:06:06.671000+00:00,lol
7394,2021-03-02T10:06:01.602000+00:00,"I don't know, you haven't answered"
7395,2021-03-02T10:05:49.066000+00:00,then what's the original need?
7396,2021-03-02T10:05:29.476000+00:00,I'm not saying that's the need
7397,2021-03-02T10:05:12.966000+00:00,but if that was a need then why would I be still okay with mixed food served to me by others?
7398,2021-03-02T10:04:54.522000+00:00,"ü§î  so you mean my intent of ""not mixing food"" is a need?"
7399,2021-03-02T10:04:17.706000+00:00,It's a consequence of other latent needs
7400,2021-03-02T10:03:54.813000+00:00,but it isn't really a need
7401,2021-03-02T10:03:43.086000+00:00,"You say it as a ""Need"""
7402,2021-03-02T10:03:25.399000+00:00,
7403,2021-03-02T10:03:23.062000+00:00,Basically the clean plate is an attribute
7404,2021-03-02T10:02:45.036000+00:00,It's not a use case
7405,2021-03-02T10:02:40.898000+00:00,that why when asked to someone else would result in something else
7406,2021-03-02T10:02:25.902000+00:00,"but your why leads to a specific usecase based on my opinion of ""clean plates"""
7407,2021-03-02T10:01:59.611000+00:00,"Until I asked ""Why' 20 times"
7408,2021-03-02T10:01:52.219000+00:00,It's what you said first
7409,2021-03-02T10:01:35.240000+00:00,but isn't it what I said here
7410,2021-03-02T10:01:05.431000+00:00,No it wasn't üòõ
7411,2021-03-02T10:00:49.795000+00:00,"the need was ""clean"" plates"
7412,2021-03-02T10:00:42.970000+00:00,wait.. where is the topic going?
7413,2021-03-02T10:00:10.335000+00:00,Which is the need the persona displays
7414,2021-03-02T10:00:02.355000+00:00,But it was not your latent need
7415,2021-03-02T09:59:57.375000+00:00,So sort of your 'need' was a clean plate
7416,2021-03-02T09:59:29.630000+00:00,But mixing up taste still had an extra layer under
7417,2021-03-02T09:59:06.694000+00:00,for some it's distribution of food in equal quantity
7418,2021-03-02T09:58:53.339000+00:00,for some it's presentation
7419,2021-03-02T09:58:49.770000+00:00,like for me it's not mixxing up taste
7420,2021-03-02T09:58:49.033000+00:00,It's not a need
7421,2021-03-02T09:58:42.960000+00:00,the end result can be different for diffferent people
7422,2021-03-02T09:58:35.928000+00:00,the original need is having clean plates
7423,2021-03-02T09:58:23.918000+00:00,that's the result of having things separated.
7424,2021-03-02T09:58:13.965000+00:00,Like my rice on top of my roti
7425,2021-03-02T09:58:08.506000+00:00,Seeing things in their original state
7426,2021-03-02T09:57:57.554000+00:00,"True, but now we're also seeing some need for having things like how they're supposed to be"
7427,2021-03-02T09:57:22.635000+00:00,how? the first want was to have clean plates for the food isn't it?
7428,2021-03-02T09:57:02.882000+00:00,So the need suddenly is very different from the first want
7429,2021-03-02T09:56:26.214000+00:00,My point is .. having clean plates to serve food on.. gives me the power to choose what I wanna mix and how much.. serving it on the same plate eliminates that power and forces me to eat something even if I otherwise might not enjoy the taste because I've mixed it .. and now I can't separate them back
7430,2021-03-02T09:55:48.145000+00:00,Who's*
7431,2021-03-02T09:55:40.969000+00:00,"Which intent are you exactly talking about then. The intent of the creator, or ingredient?"
7432,2021-03-02T09:55:15.117000+00:00,"So if I summarize. You find it important that things are left in their original state? Or, that they were meant a specific way?"
7433,2021-03-02T09:55:08.765000+00:00,and if they were.. then we would have had a different name for it
7434,2021-03-02T09:54:58.421000+00:00,they weren't meant to be together
7435,2021-03-02T09:54:52.810000+00:00,vanilla is different taste .. chocolate is different
7436,2021-03-02T09:54:43.203000+00:00,there is a reason you call it vanilla chocolate flavour
7437,2021-03-02T09:54:32.645000+00:00,it's like an accident
7438,2021-03-02T09:54:00.588000+00:00,it removes the purity out of it?
7439,2021-03-02T09:53:51.866000+00:00,a mix of taste .. hiding the original intended pure flavour
7440,2021-03-02T09:53:31.892000+00:00,But what does this imply for you?
7441,2021-03-02T09:53:28.565000+00:00,a mix of colors based on his emotions
7442,2021-03-02T09:53:21.654000+00:00,his works was a mix
7443,2021-03-02T09:53:17.257000+00:00,Artist Pollock
7444,2021-03-02T09:53:00.991000+00:00,What do you mean by that?
7445,2021-03-02T09:52:35.837000+00:00,vanilla chocolate icecreams is a pollock painting
7446,2021-03-02T09:52:13.726000+00:00,"What if it's, vanilla chocolate icecream?"
7447,2021-03-02T09:52:13.206000+00:00,so that I enjoy the meal in it's intended original taste
7448,2021-03-02T09:51:56.031000+00:00,But why is this separation of flavors so important?
7449,2021-03-02T09:51:05.225000+00:00,it's a personal preference. like I would not like to mix vanilla and strawberry icecream.. I wanna enjoy vanilla as a single flavour and relish it and then enjoy strawberry separately
7450,2021-03-02T09:50:59.316000+00:00,I'm just sitting here reading this interrogation  <:PanPopcorn:697917149368418309>
7451,2021-03-02T09:50:24.045000+00:00,Why though?
7452,2021-03-02T09:50:06.806000+00:00,if you're cooking one portion for yourself though I guess ü§î
7453,2021-03-02T09:49:35.394000+00:00,yes
7454,2021-03-02T09:49:30.668000+00:00,because the pot would have great quantity.. if you accidentally mix saliva or something else which wasn't meant to be.. chances of the food getting rotten is higher
7455,2021-03-02T09:49:03.936000+00:00,Is it important that the taste of food does not interfere with other food?
7456,2021-03-02T09:48:52.146000+00:00,"why serve it on a plate, why not eat out of the pot you cooked in? <:smartboi:697917149548904448>"
7457,2021-03-02T09:48:13.155000+00:00,so that the no food interferes with the taste of the other
7458,2021-03-02T09:47:53.657000+00:00,but i prefer having them on different plates
7459,2021-03-02T09:47:45.930000+00:00,like if someone mixes food and serves it .. I'm okay. i won't reject food
7460,2021-03-02T09:47:31.535000+00:00,Why does it matter that it looks good?
7461,2021-03-02T09:47:29.340000+00:00,not it's not important
7462,2021-03-02T09:47:19.549000+00:00,like it looks good
7463,2021-03-02T09:47:15.903000+00:00,And you find it important to feel cleaner and more organized?
7464,2021-03-02T09:47:06.026000+00:00,more organized
7465,2021-03-02T09:46:56.550000+00:00,it feels cleaner
7466,2021-03-02T09:46:47.428000+00:00,How does it feel if you eat differently?
7467,2021-03-02T09:46:18.082000+00:00,it's weird but yea
7468,2021-03-02T09:46:10.575000+00:00,it's just how I eat
7469,2021-03-02T09:46:03.002000+00:00,How come?
7470,2021-03-02T09:45:50.565000+00:00,and curry on another
7471,2021-03-02T09:45:46.662000+00:00,like I cannot mix curry and rice together. I'll have rice separately on a different plate
7472,2021-03-02T09:45:29.515000+00:00,üòÇ  because I do not like other food mixing with the one I am having right now
7473,2021-03-02T09:42:54.203000+00:00,"Because ""Need clean dishes to serve food on"" is still clearly a want! üòõ"
7474,2021-03-02T09:40:39.252000+00:00,Why does that matter to you?
7475,2021-03-02T09:39:47.988000+00:00,for might even change the taste of the food otherwise
7476,2021-03-02T09:39:33.925000+00:00,because stained one might become a breeding ground for fungus
7477,2021-03-02T09:39:04.683000+00:00,Why you want clean dishes to serve food on?
7478,2021-03-02T09:38:48.979000+00:00,or maybe because I need the clean dishes to serve food on
7479,2021-03-02T09:30:18.333000+00:00,Use the laddering technique to research this!
7480,2021-03-02T09:30:10.212000+00:00,No problem!
7481,2021-03-02T09:25:37.616000+00:00,i cannot thank you enough for these
7482,2021-03-02T09:24:04.149000+00:00,"Or maybe I have a deep fear for people thinking I'm not clean, so I have the need preserving my social image"
7483,2021-03-02T09:23:53.102000+00:00,Maybe I have a deep fear for microbes
7484,2021-03-02T09:23:29.962000+00:00,Why do I want clean dishes?
7485,2021-03-02T09:23:23.602000+00:00,Then if we go a level deeper
7486,2021-03-02T09:23:14.216000+00:00,"Or maybe I need the assurance, that my dishes are really clean and I think warm water is the goal"
7487,2021-03-02T09:21:58.790000+00:00,Maybe I just need the comfort of having nice warms hands when doing dishes
7488,2021-03-02T09:21:36.942000+00:00,But why do I want warm water>
7489,2021-03-02T09:20:49.528000+00:00,My want is that the water is a good enough temperature so I don't burn my hands
7490,2021-03-02T09:20:22.511000+00:00,"So for example, when my goal is to wash the dishes"
7491,2021-03-02T09:18:27.421000+00:00,Or things that support my goals
7492,2021-03-02T09:18:07.716000+00:00,Needs are things that are very positive for my goals
7493,2021-03-02T09:17:24.649000+00:00,"what happens if i throw a ""goals"" into the mix"
7494,2021-03-02T09:15:16.466000+00:00,Which makes UX research difficult
7495,2021-03-02T09:14:50.614000+00:00,"In other words, the want is the persons solution for their need. So when you research them, they will tell you want they want, not what they need, because usually people don't really know what they need"
7496,2021-03-02T09:11:33.210000+00:00,"thank again, another great example üôÇ"
7497,2021-03-02T09:08:43.813000+00:00,So the need was to the knowledge of how long they still need to wait
7498,2021-03-02T09:07:34.590000+00:00,"However, the solution was showing the time for when the train came"
7499,2021-03-02T09:06:46.941000+00:00,So the want = I want the train to be faster
7500,2021-03-02T09:06:27.621000+00:00,"People complained that train waiting times were too long, it was a really bad experience waiting for the train"
7501,2021-03-02T09:05:53.961000+00:00,Another good example is trains!
7502,2021-03-02T09:04:56.681000+00:00,ye true that :p
7503,2021-03-02T09:04:33.987000+00:00,"Always good to verify with him/her, since he/she will be grading you! üòÇ"
7504,2021-03-02T09:03:41.254000+00:00,this makes way more sense than my teacher
7505,2021-03-02T09:03:07.926000+00:00,"thank you so much , both of you"

7507,2021-03-02T09:02:09.101000+00:00,Take a look at this technique too
7508,2021-03-02T09:01:12.827000+00:00,üòÇ  omg.. the mirror example is epic
7509,2021-03-02T09:00:57.630000+00:00,"Because their need was ""Having something to do"""
7510,2021-03-02T09:00:35.596000+00:00,But the solution was actually putting mirrors into elevators
7511,2021-03-02T08:59:38.812000+00:00,People want the elevator to be faster.
7512,2021-03-02T08:59:23.447000+00:00,But cars was the solution because it was build on the same need.
7513,2021-03-02T08:58:47.874000+00:00,People wanted faster horses
7514,2021-03-02T08:58:40.929000+00:00,A guess the famous quite
7515,2021-03-02T08:58:06.755000+00:00,Laddering is a good technique for researching this specifically
7516,2021-03-02T08:57:13.661000+00:00,But actually I need just to have my social desire sated
7517,2021-03-02T08:57:04.712000+00:00,I want to talk a lot on discord
7518,2021-03-02T08:39:57.840000+00:00,"since ""needs"" is something that's discovered after doing your research and identifying the drawbacks"
7519,2021-03-02T08:39:29.828000+00:00,However for the persona you can consider them as same imo
7520,2021-03-02T08:38:51.956000+00:00,"Nope. though from a language point of view they are kinda different 

~
want -> means what the user is asking for in a product
needs -> means what you feel the user should have in the product
~
From a reality perspective, the want might not always be same as the need, a user might want xyz, but the reason behind that want might be something else and can be discovered as a need"
7521,2021-03-02T08:22:00.319000+00:00,"hello , i am currently working on creating my persona for my MA project and i have been asked to include user wants, but, i don't understand what these are. Are they different from user needs?"

7525,2021-02-27T04:54:27.828000+00:00,"common? probably not, but i'm seeing more and more people do it so that they can put their work out there."
7526,2021-02-26T23:09:43.546000+00:00,Better to just say exactly what you mean.
7527,2021-02-26T23:08:21.058000+00:00,"And some people /twist/ the term to fit their own agenda. Use it as a cudgel, or a gate."
7528,2021-02-26T23:07:02.897000+00:00,"UX Designer is just a term that people use to describe things, like interaction design, or information architecture, or a person who cares about usability."
7529,2021-02-26T23:06:20.010000+00:00,"but <@!125407753266135041> hit the nail on the head. The UX Designer designs things.. but they arent the experience. Its a slice of the experience, viewed through the lens of a designer."
7530,2021-02-26T23:05:47.055000+00:00,"I'm really glad the converastion panned out the way it did, because I had to step away"
7531,2021-02-26T22:26:00.830000+00:00,Lots of those NN post could as well be portfolio cases for researchers
7532,2021-02-26T22:22:24.151000+00:00,"Though instead of ending with a product solution you can end with a research conclusion(s), choosing certain points of focus where the design must pay attention to"
7533,2021-02-26T22:21:28.941000+00:00,You don't really put raw data there anyway
7534,2021-02-26T22:21:16.888000+00:00,"It can still be quite visual, representing all the data"
7535,2021-02-26T22:20:43.530000+00:00,I suppose so
7536,2021-02-26T22:15:58.440000+00:00,im sorry to derail this convo but im wondering if its common for design researchers have websites of their work??
7537,2021-02-26T21:35:15.695000+00:00,"Here's an article from Alan that touches a bit on the topic of words and such thrown around in the world of UX 

https://mralancooper.medium.com/the-endless-battle-575f4282ffe5"
7538,2021-02-26T21:33:36.603000+00:00,Yeah and this is where it circles back to the what mattering more than the name.
7539,2021-02-26T21:24:53.641000+00:00,I rather call myself digital product designer as well
7540,2021-02-26T21:23:29.370000+00:00,Yeah I definitely can agree with that
7541,2021-02-26T21:17:07.537000+00:00,"Yeah, it's mostly a semantics thing. Where I feel the title and the job don't align. Prefer saying like interaction designer or product designer or something more direct."
7542,2021-02-26T21:15:12.611000+00:00,"Ahh, so what you're saying; calling yourself UX designer is egoistical, because you're implying that you designed the experience, while the developers speed optimization (one of the people) is just as much experience as anything else?"
7543,2021-02-26T21:13:19.252000+00:00,Even the environment will play a part in the experience. So the important bit is to control and work on what you can control and iterate on that.
7544,2021-02-26T21:11:51.081000+00:00,Like no one person is owning the entire experience
7545,2021-02-26T21:11:35.913000+00:00,Correct
7546,2021-02-26T21:11:02.099000+00:00,And beyond what one person is doing you're talking in relation to the entire team?
7547,2021-02-26T21:08:43.653000+00:00,All things that make up the UX but are beyond what one person is doing
7548,2021-02-26T21:08:32.594000+00:00,Yeah or even just how well it can interpret what you say or how well the speakers are or how much the car isolates outside noise to allow you to properly communicate with it
7549,2021-02-26T21:07:58.529000+00:00,"How friendly the voice is, caring, calming etc can't be seen as anything else than designing experience I think."
7550,2021-02-26T21:06:27.464000+00:00,But the experience of the tone in a AI generated voice
7551,2021-02-26T21:05:45.453000+00:00,Then i don't mean the interaction side of it
7552,2021-02-26T21:05:26.615000+00:00,You're just doing the subjective experience
7553,2021-02-26T21:05:08.248000+00:00,If for example the UX of a specific smart car voice interface
7554,2021-02-26T21:05:00.277000+00:00,"Mostly just don't put yourself on a pedestal when saying you ""do UX"""
7555,2021-02-26T21:04:42.740000+00:00,I guess it depends on what type of thing you're designing too
7556,2021-02-26T21:04:08.169000+00:00,Yeah for sure. Trying to predict how it might play out or influence a certain piece of it
7557,2021-02-26T21:03:27.490000+00:00,I guess you're more attempting to predict a certain experience than design it
7558,2021-02-26T21:02:50.805000+00:00,Ahh in that sense
7559,2021-02-26T21:01:55.400000+00:00,Had to find the right words
7560,2021-02-26T21:01:49.738000+00:00,"Yeah that's a good question. Let me first clarify that I have no issue with the term UX. 

My problem is that calling what you do as UX Design feels egotistical. There's so much that goes into UX that goes beyond what one person is designing. You can design pieces of the puzzle and take feedback and iterate on it, but what you do is never the full user experience. You can design pieces that add up to or affect the experience but you can never control the full experience. 

Even how a digital product is coded will affect the UX and no amount of your IA, interaction, layout design, or UI will change that. Or even how the servers are configured. Now you can pull research and feedback to address those things and ""design"" it better I suppose. But ultimately all I can do is design a product and iterate it to hopefully make the experience ""good"" but to say you can fully be in control of the UX and how a user goes about using a product feels off. But me saying how a page should look or how it should act doesn't really create the experience but rather a piece of it.

If that all makes sense. In general, it feels like you're placing your role or work higher than it should be. Not to say it isn't important but rather that designing the interactions and UI etc is only a small piece of everything that will affect the UX but isn't designing it as a whole."
7561,2021-02-26T21:00:01.140000+00:00,I bet <@125407753266135041> is typing a novel üòÇ
7562,2021-02-26T20:59:16.688000+00:00,"Is well, end in certain conclusions, which can then be used to design experience"
7563,2021-02-26T20:58:37.500000+00:00,Put research still needs to be translated into experience
7564,2021-02-26T20:58:27.329000+00:00,That's the research part yeah
7565,2021-02-26T20:58:10.583000+00:00,I just feel that you predominantly do research in order to get to your design.
7566,2021-02-26T20:57:14.353000+00:00,The primary task?
7567,2021-02-26T20:56:31.968000+00:00,What is the primary task though
7568,2021-02-26T20:51:50.984000+00:00,Experience is designable
7569,2021-02-26T20:50:59.985000+00:00,Why do you hate the term though?
7570,2021-02-26T20:46:14.168000+00:00,Afaik Don Norman came up with the term
7571,2021-02-26T20:39:25.674000+00:00,Somewhere someone in HR came up with that name and it's being misused worldwide. Ux Researcher is probably more accurate.
7572,2021-02-26T19:51:26.348000+00:00,
7573,2021-02-26T19:51:15.743000+00:00,Oh that's another that I love. Hate the term UX designer but it has become the norm so just roll with it
7574,2021-02-26T19:24:31.528000+00:00,I like this take üòâ https://twitter.com/mralancooper/status/992200502740893696?lang=en

Values"
7576,2021-02-26T17:50:25.010000+00:00,I usually tend to keep something like:
7577,2021-02-26T16:20:22.467000+00:00,Oh yeah. About Face is super solid
7578,2021-02-26T16:19:01.338000+00:00,"I actually didn't know Cooper came up with them, TIL. I do really like the book About Face though"
7579,2021-02-26T16:14:08.104000+00:00,I mean he did invent design personas so his views do carry a bit of weight haha to me at least
7580,2021-02-26T16:06:57.586000+00:00,"I like this take, make it as goal-oriented as possible"

7582,2021-02-25T22:17:03.254000+00:00,Even down to how to influence people to not forget their passport when flying is done differently in lets say Netherlands compared to Germany
7583,2021-02-25T22:10:25.099000+00:00,But I guess also the flawed assumptions people have about this culture
7584,2021-02-25T22:09:32.720000+00:00,The very definition of culture is in behaviour
7585,2021-02-25T22:08:24.077000+00:00,But saying location doesn't influence behaviour is strange
7586,2021-02-25T22:07:47.664000+00:00,I guess I agree that's it's easy to make assumptions based demographics
7587,2021-02-25T22:03:13.308000+00:00,"But yes, usually not relevant"
7588,2021-02-25T22:03:04.814000+00:00,Still an example either way
7589,2021-02-25T21:58:31.146000+00:00,a part of me dies every time i read through marketing research....the buckets of demographics makes me feel yucky

7600,2021-02-25T21:53:13.607000+00:00,Also uses demographic variables as an important factor
7601,2021-02-25T21:53:01.302000+00:00,Also behavioural theory like https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_belief_model

7604,2021-02-25T21:52:20.456000+00:00,Demographics can play a role sometimes though
7605,2021-02-25T21:52:07.083000+00:00,"personas should contain scenarios, goals, contexts and behaviors (attitudes, motivation)"

7609,2021-02-25T21:41:14.021000+00:00,to quote the mighty curmudgeon Jared Spool: Demographics have no place in personas.
7610,2021-02-25T19:23:38.757000+00:00,"excellent advice, thanks Magz üôÇ"
7611,2021-02-25T19:21:39.238000+00:00,"makes sense - i tend to do a brain dump of questions and then make notes on ""why am i asking this question?"" ""what do i hope to get out of this question?"" ""once i have an answer, what will I do with it?"" ""how will this help inform or drive any decisions?"" and when you can't answer those in a clear user-centered way, it's probably good to cut it out of the survey"
7612,2021-02-25T19:19:27.322000+00:00,"Some background, I've always had access to a research team, so this is the first time I've not had access to one. So I'm kind of winging these surveys... This first part of the survey is to gather some basic info. The second part is more focused on investment and betting/gambling. It was originally put together by my manager, but I'm trying to flesh it out a little. I can also cut back where necessary, if needed"
7613,2021-02-25T19:15:21.564000+00:00,I feel like the pool is more diverse in finance that what is currently represented and I'll need some data to back that up. But your point about not including gender if it won't inform design decisions makes sense. Having this info can help me change some minds up the chain that maybe we should be focusing our efforts in other areas
7614,2021-02-25T19:12:27.291000+00:00,uxr
7615,2021-02-25T19:11:35.620000+00:00,is this for marketing or UXR?
7616,2021-02-25T19:11:13.224000+00:00,üò¨  demographics-based personas?
7617,2021-02-25T19:03:45.332000+00:00,"It is, yes. The product is for a typically male demographic, but I'd love to see how diverse it really is. It could, in effect, alter our personas"
7618,2021-02-25T18:58:33.479000+00:00,is gender an important question to have? this type of question is usually not recommended if it's not driving or informing any design decision
7619,2021-02-25T18:44:48.314000+00:00,"By default, Google forms recommends this"
7620,2021-02-25T18:43:37.197000+00:00,I feel like maybe a mix of the two would be a good approach?
7621,2021-02-25T18:40:51.974000+00:00,"Hey everyone. Building out a survey, working on basic info atm. Wondering what everyone's thoughts were on options for gender, Found these two options on the web"
7622,2021-02-25T17:51:38.837000+00:00,Because if all questions are prepared you probably not going to find anything unexpected.
7623,2021-02-25T17:48:24.814000+00:00,I think it's important to keep the tasks the same. Feels weird to prepare too many questions.
7624,2021-02-25T17:46:29.916000+00:00,Depends on the type of testing too
7625,2021-02-25T17:39:47.624000+00:00,yeah if you change the questions you'll have less data to work with but if you think it will help you understand more then maybe do some further research separately
7626,2021-02-25T17:39:40.296000+00:00,thank you richard!
7627,2021-02-25T17:38:23.683000+00:00,"I usually have a fixed set of x questions for all participants.. once those are done, you can switch over to more personalized questions based on observations about the participant"
7628,2021-02-25T17:37:28.812000+00:00,if asking the question brings new information or observation then it would be great to ask. But keeping the questions same helps you to do comparative study more easily.
7629,2021-02-25T17:26:38.040000+00:00,"Hi guys, would you say it's okay to change the tasks/questions you ask between usability testing? Or is it better to keep it the same?"

7633,2021-02-24T23:45:53.639000+00:00,I'm looking at what would be a good way to conduct user testing for my mobile prototype and later present it. I don't know if that helps but I'd love to know the different ways you're able to share.

7652,2021-02-24T18:09:57.267000+00:00,yeah but in that case how we will get  users? One option will be through survey. But like how in some other country ??

7654,2021-02-24T17:51:26.070000+00:00,What should be done in case of user research if the product is completely based in some other country? Like I am working on a web project which is based in Dubai and I live in India.
7655,2021-02-24T03:30:30.519000+00:00,Do you have additional context behind what kind of user testing you're referring to? So that we know what area of focus we can share. (:
7656,2021-02-23T18:53:38.467000+00:00,Hi all! What are your guy's processes for user testing? Can anyone share how they like to conduct their tests?
7657,2021-02-23T18:33:24.512000+00:00,Maybe ask at <#772735238455033886>
7658,2021-02-23T18:33:12.053000+00:00,But my opinion is not from an experienced background by any meansüëÄ
7659,2021-02-23T18:31:56.788000+00:00,"Unless you know business strategy, because business is not design"
7660,2021-02-23T18:31:33.163000+00:00,But don't make design decisions based on them
7661,2021-02-23T18:31:22.565000+00:00,Doesn't hurt to know them I think? Can be nice for stakeholder mapping!
7662,2021-02-23T18:28:20.992000+00:00,So unless you have a degree in business economics (or aiming) you probably shouldn't meddle too much into that
7663,2021-02-23T18:27:39.016000+00:00,"Most likely most businesses know their own needs pretty well, they just don't know their user needs"
7664,2021-02-23T18:25:46.476000+00:00,If your goal is to design user centric you probably should only concern yourself with user needs.
7665,2021-02-23T18:22:23.242000+00:00,I guess that depends on the specific business needs.
7666,2021-02-23T17:10:46.863000+00:00,"Hi all, what are your thoughts on balancing business needs and user need when researching. We've recently started a project where the two researchers (myself and one other lady) on the team were not advised on any business needs, and we found our participants asking about the business needs (its a new partnership). do you think researchers should know business needs before researching or will it be better off only capturing user needs without knowledge of business objectives, since its user-centred design after all. Interested in knowing opinions on this one!"

7673,2021-02-20T09:19:31.122000+00:00,So better to make it a little more personal
7674,2021-02-20T09:19:15.451000+00:00,"They do you a favor, by helping with the research"
7675,2021-02-20T09:18:53.424000+00:00,I would stay away from templates.
7676,2021-02-19T23:45:39.761000+00:00,Was wondering if anyone has recommendations for a good go-to email template for recruiting user interview participants?
7677,2021-02-19T08:55:24.169000+00:00,Though probably misses what series of questions you're going to ask and how they're valid.
7678,2021-02-19T08:54:24.858000+00:00,I guess who you're going to test should already be clear if you made a user profile
7679,2021-02-19T08:54:03.432000+00:00,"Could maybe something more like

""Hypothesis: People are comfortable sharing their location""

""To verify we will ask people to share their location live when entering the building""

""And measure how comfortable people are doing this, by asking a series of questions when they're back""

""We are wrong if more than 1/5 people experienced this as uncomfortable"""
7680,2021-02-19T08:42:03.833000+00:00,But it's certainly better to try and disprove it rather than prove it
7681,2021-02-19T08:38:02.620000+00:00,I guess the test card would work better if you have like 10 of them
7682,2021-02-19T08:37:26.702000+00:00,Because it doesn't seek to test 1 concrete example
7683,2021-02-19T08:36:54.686000+00:00,"The research plan isn't that much more detailed, actually less so maybe"
7684,2021-02-19T08:36:43.252000+00:00,I think it's a lot more detailed in its own way
7685,2021-02-18T22:28:51.773000+00:00,"Right right, I guess my qualm with the test card is that it doesn't even feel like it has enough detail for the goals of design research. Certainly fine for the scrappy, no resources style of research some may do, but I don't think its in-depth enough for even start-ups/small companies, much less design agencies or in-house researchers at larger companies."
7686,2021-02-18T07:47:41.252000+00:00,That one is certainly more detailed indeed!
7687,2021-02-18T07:45:25.623000+00:00,"Design research is different from science research though, in their goals"
7688,2021-02-18T02:00:18.456000+00:00,"Never used it before but it looks super interesting and concise. I love research plans that are short and to the point - ""what are we studying, why, and what do we want to know when we're finished with the study?"". That being said, I don't think I'm a fan of this, the phrasing feels a bit off from a typical empirical approach - researchers, in general, don't set to verify hypothesis, rather try to disprove them or discover new insights. The ""We are right if..."" feels very narrow, very corporate and driven by KPIs rather than a meaningful experience or engagement.  Not to mention the lack of specifics, who are they testing with? Why those people? Why are they doing this test in the first place? How will they conduct the test? Metrics with only click-through don't deserve a whole page to themselves, rather should be apart of a larger research plan or development cycle. 

Personally, I follow this one-pager and it balances conciseness and details, imo https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2012/01/ux-research-plan-stakeholders-love/"

7752,2021-02-09T03:31:27.927000+00:00,"To throw another idea out there for recruiting people - think about other ways to reach people who are in or near the ""target user"" group - doesn't have to be one-on-one reach out, but I am often surprised by how much people are willing to give feedback, especially if its a short amount of time (<30 minutes + one or two tasks). Example, did a project in the fall on Theater/performing arts - found a few subreddits that allowed study advertisement and got 10 people, which worked out great for my lack of resources for payment. 
Other thought is: Do you *need* participants who are not related to UX /friends/family? As long as you aren't burning them out from asking too often and they are similar-ish to the target user group, you'll be pretty good, at least for a personal project (though targeting the right user group is a plus for most research projects (or even necessary))"

I'm doing tests with our target audience and users regularly to see how opinions of our product fluctuate after each sprint and I'm looking for the best way to store and compare over time opinions like ""on the screen X button Y have an unclear copy"", or ""user can't find a way to start a new X"", etc.
What's more, ofc from time to time we ship a new feature and I'd like to be able to easily update my dataset with a new column/tag/whatever where I could start writing down new comments."

I'd like to ask you what, in your opinion, is the best way to collect and store feedback from the UX interviews?

First I've been keeping insights from our users on some kind of ""matrix"" on Miro, with tags, categories and everything, but it was kind of clunky when it got bigger.
Then I tried storing it on ClickUp and creating many custom fields by which I could easily sort, filter and triangulate some of our users' opinions (I need them to be easily findable by the topic and/or participant at the least), but even thou ClickUp is a great tool, I couldn't find myself a good setup to make it all accessible.

Maybe there is a software that perfectly answers my problems, but I just couldn't find it :P

PS.: sorry if I'm not really clear with my question, but English is not my primary language.

PPS.: is this the right channel for this, or should I post it elsewhere?"

7795,2021-01-28T20:11:44.570000+00:00,"Take my opinion with a grain of salt (and I could be totally wrong here) because I'm still learning but from my understanding, a user flow is building the intuitive flow of the site. Ex: your user is on a landing page, what do they do next? Okay most people are looking for your most popular services, so you put a button at the top of the fold for ""our services"" and that links them to the services page. If they keep scrolling, they're looking for more about what that company is about, so here's the things the company does. Pop another ""services"" button, etc. It's basically the guided story a company is trying to tell a user about them and their call to action to use their services. 

A site map is just the overall set up of a website, it's just here's the landing page, and all the pages it connects to, makes sure it makes sense that each page should come after the next in the overall narrative that is your company's website. It's like a company's table of contents if we keep using the book/story analogy."
7796,2021-01-28T20:11:40.890000+00:00,User flow is a visual representation of a specific flow of action the user takes in order to achieve a specific goal
7797,2021-01-28T20:10:57.885000+00:00,Sitemap is a visual representation of a sites content

7799,2021-01-28T19:56:30.739000+00:00,"Omg can I just nerd out for a second - I am doing a IA certification right now and we are talking about IA models and what's expected, when to use it. We're talking about content labeling and taxonomy and omg üòç this makes me so happy. I'm probably older than many people here but in my past life I was in school to do geology and paleontology for a little bit in my early 20s, and my favorite parts of that was the incredibly specific taxonomic choices and cataloging methodology and it hits that same nerve for me. I LOVE this whole IA/UX research route and I can absolutely see how my current life of being a developer overlaps with this."
7800,2021-01-28T19:45:08.481000+00:00,is the above image considered a flow chart and the one before that a site map?
7801,2021-01-28T19:44:07.951000+00:00,IA is the umbrella term

7808,2021-01-27T21:41:37.759000+00:00,You really got complex diagrams like:
7809,2021-01-27T21:41:27.944000+00:00,I mean if everything i connected to everything else
7810,2021-01-27T21:38:39.513000+00:00,"But yeah, hard to know if that works, I've now idea how many interaction points you have"
7811,2021-01-27T21:37:35.098000+00:00,I guess you can do some creative fun things with them
7812,2021-01-27T21:37:21.707000+00:00,"Yeah, maybe you need to try a flow chart instead then"
7813,2021-01-27T21:31:28.268000+00:00,"Made priority guides, those are nice <:11yay:728039016854847579>"
7814,2021-01-27T21:30:55.380000+00:00,"But huh, yeah, that sure tells you can get from any one to any other pretty clearly!"
7815,2021-01-27T21:30:16.414000+00:00,"But unlike the example up there, it has a lot of things under it just like the other pages"
7816,2021-01-27T21:30:00.239000+00:00,"Okay, yep"
7817,2021-01-27T21:28:50.432000+00:00,I guess for apps you can make priority guides instead as well
7818,2021-01-27T21:25:57.339000+00:00,"Yeah I guess it isn't a home in name, but still a clear starting section"
7819,2021-01-27T21:24:07.170000+00:00,"But Doordash opens straight into the delivery function, Google Maps opens into the map + search function"
7820,2021-01-27T21:23:19.187000+00:00,On mobile mine defaults back to whatever I had previously open
7821,2021-01-27T21:20:41.022000+00:00,The friends panel I think?
7822,2021-01-27T21:20:35.737000+00:00,Even Discord does
7823,2021-01-27T21:19:11.132000+00:00,"There's always some sort of default that the app opens into, even if it's not necessarily a ""home page"""
7824,2021-01-27T21:16:28.654000+00:00,Why not? You still have your starting screen when you open your app right?
7825,2021-01-27T21:12:56.909000+00:00,Just often doesn't happen?
7826,2021-01-27T21:12:49.357000+00:00,"Which, in mobile apps?"
7827,2021-01-27T21:12:35.999000+00:00,Oh yeah! but these examples all imply there is a homepage ^^
7828,2021-01-27T21:00:08.538000+00:00,That it's at the bottom is out of the scope of a sitemap
7829,2021-01-27T20:59:34.672000+00:00,The bottom nav would just be part of the nav
7830,2021-01-27T20:57:21.222000+00:00,
7831,2021-01-27T20:57:18.812000+00:00,I suppose like this
7832,2021-01-27T20:57:10.038000+00:00,Or well
7833,2021-01-27T20:56:22.852000+00:00,Sitemaps are not flowcharts FYI
7834,2021-01-27T20:55:20.383000+00:00,Maybe I can just put them in a box together ^^
7835,2021-01-27T20:51:43.826000+00:00,"sure you can put them in a triangle or even square if there's more, but that makes it hard to connect other things haha"
7836,2021-01-27T20:51:22.467000+00:00,"all the online examples have like a ""home"" starting point, but that seems unrealistic, really you just end up in the first tab and can go to any"
7837,2021-01-27T20:50:52.183000+00:00,"pretty small question I think, how would you go about showing you can go from any one page in a bottom nav to all the others in a sitemap/flowchart?"
7838,2021-01-27T15:36:17.367000+00:00,Probably not for your WoW acc
7839,2021-01-27T15:36:10.613000+00:00,"Especially for e-commerce, because reducing the steps is usually good for the conversion and most people don't care about their amazon password anyway"

7841,2021-01-27T12:23:17.681000+00:00,"Is it me, or does this look off? (green step)"
7842,2021-01-27T12:23:08.920000+00:00,I don't think you should log in automatically after the password reset

7873,2021-01-25T12:22:06.438000+00:00,So then it can be a journey of someones average day
7874,2021-01-25T12:21:54.619000+00:00,I'm used to making them before a product concept
7875,2021-01-25T12:21:40.107000+00:00,I guess you can use user journeys in a lot of different ways
7876,2021-01-25T08:04:17.631000+00:00,Yeah I thought so too. Thanks!
7877,2021-01-25T07:52:20.492000+00:00,It really depends .. the user journey is completely based on their end goal.. if they both have the same end goal they you can use the same one.. if it's different then naturally you gotta evolve it.. pretty sure teachers will have a more complex and different one then students
7878,2021-01-25T07:43:29.508000+00:00,"Hi, so I'm working on a project about online classes where I'm focusing on the experience of both students and teachers. Obviously both use platforms to interact, so should I use the same user journey to map their experience or separate ones?"
7879,2021-01-24T02:55:13.345000+00:00,Dude it's the most well explained presentation i saw in a while thank you so much üòÅ <@402341919939887104>
7880,2021-01-24T02:51:10.795000+00:00,"1. User journey is the path the user will experience with the different module while using the application
2. user flow is how the user will navigate through the module to reach a destined target
~
User journey includes the emotional aspect, thinking of the user, actions and what possible outcomes the user is looking for.. this basically talks about the emotional and mental state of the user while using the application
~
User flow only talks about the static expected flow the user has to take to reach the goal and does not involve other factors like environment, time, urgency, emotion or other stuff.. It's just a basic flow chart

7881,2021-01-24T02:37:38.565000+00:00,Hey guys can someone tell me what's the difference between user journey and userflow ? i feel like it's the same thing
7882,2021-01-22T19:02:06.698000+00:00,Ooh thank you! I will look into that.
7883,2021-01-22T18:51:12.611000+00:00,Especially cognitive topics are always a big thing in UXR
7884,2021-01-22T16:29:26.862000+00:00,Thank you! This is a great start.
7885,2021-01-22T16:27:43.355000+00:00,http://simonpan.com/work/uber/ Simonpan's work is a good example of this
7886,2021-01-22T16:26:10.081000+00:00,"Though I haven't had this experience of exclusively focusing on research alone, my advice would be for you to look into resources such as www.nngroup.com to read upon various research insight and case studies. You can then dwell further by observing your own behavior on different websites, apps and stuff and you can try and recreate different test scenarios using various user testing tools.. through that you can write case studies .. maybe on linkedin / medium or maybe even a blog.. this would not help you gain more knowledge.. but probably will also put the spotlight on your work and could be great if you are applying for such a role in future."
7887,2021-01-22T16:20:16.754000+00:00,"Yes, I have utilized the ADP list, and I got a great mentor/connection out of it. She had some great resources I'm utilizing. I'm more looking for someone to help give me some direction about things I can do right now (I have a blog that I use, I'm wondering what sorts of things I could write about? Like a diary study using public information? What do I search on google to find that information?). I just finished reading some articles about the need for storytelling in data science and research so that is a blog post topic I can write about and share on linkedin."
7888,2021-01-22T16:14:42.245000+00:00,have you looked into adplist.org for the same? You can talk with mentors 1:1 there üôÇ and they are very open to helping out.

I have non-traditional path to this point but I've been told by a couple of people in UX that I would be a good fit in UX research. I really like the world of research as I explore it. I'm building some connections with researchers, and applying for contract research work when I can find it, applying for scholarships for professional development when I can find it, signing up for conferences. I was wondering if there was someone around that I could talk to about it some more to help get my foot in the door into research? Thanks!"

7898,2021-01-21T13:17:49.268000+00:00,I think our team viewed data gathering at the time of throwing this together as putting together ALL the desk research and interview data for analysis if that makes sense
7899,2021-01-21T10:45:19.113000+00:00,"Now some things feel a bit weird. Your desk research and data gathering are at a very different place, which makes things hard to follow"

7919,2021-01-19T23:08:44.833000+00:00,I guess the persona needs to inspire something you would want to design for them
7920,2021-01-19T23:08:17.536000+00:00,
7921,2021-01-19T23:08:15.529000+00:00,I tried something more simpler like

7926,2021-01-19T23:02:12.436000+00:00,"This is kind of what I have done in the past, but I feel like its too much"

7929,2021-01-19T23:00:51.435000+00:00,For me specifically I always find Job To Be Done framework useful
7930,2021-01-19T22:57:12.718000+00:00,Yeah
7931,2021-01-19T22:56:44.658000+00:00,For specific products too?
7932,2021-01-19T22:55:49.551000+00:00,I'm primarily doing one for product
7933,2021-01-19T22:55:35.629000+00:00,I guess it's kinda hard to have a universal one especially depending on the context
7934,2021-01-19T22:55:15.345000+00:00,"Yeah, I've come across so many and they all lack something"
7935,2021-01-19T22:50:22.284000+00:00,"Too many opinions regarding what's a 'good' persona, so I doubt there will ever be a universal model"

7937,2021-01-19T22:49:13.223000+00:00,"Nope, everyone presents them differently. Depending whether you're in advertising or product too"
7938,2021-01-19T22:47:47.379000+00:00,Like is there an industry standard for how they are presented?
7939,2021-01-19T22:46:47.164000+00:00,"Sorry, I meant like the layout of the actual document"

7943,2021-01-19T22:37:56.744000+00:00,Does anyone have a good example of a user persona?
7944,2021-01-19T18:03:21.142000+00:00,Just my team members. We are a small team and I need a fresh pair of eyes on my design. They encompass everyone from CEO to the dev.
7945,2021-01-19T12:49:18.126000+00:00,"Still depends on what you want feedback though! Who are these people, what is their role, what do they do?"
7946,2021-01-19T11:02:54.207000+00:00,I am actually asking for feedback from my team. So they have a general idea of what it is. I am not really testing anything but taking general feedback.
7947,2021-01-19T09:06:35.098000+00:00,Apparently satellite images aren't obvious enough for something being about satellites üòÇ
7948,2021-01-19T09:06:14.967000+00:00,I once did a fun one about satellites
7949,2021-01-19T09:05:25.017000+00:00,"You let someone scroll through a one pager, let them look at it for 5 seconds (without telling why) and they should be able to tell you what the one pager is about"
7950,2021-01-19T09:04:48.905000+00:00,I think 5 seconds test is a very good one for one pagers
7951,2021-01-19T09:02:14.262000+00:00,Introspection is flawed
7952,2021-01-19T08:59:59.021000+00:00,"A general rule of research is that you don't want to 'ask' though, you want to measure/test. So if you want to know how easy it is, you give them a challenge and see how many seconds it takes before they complete it."
7953,2021-01-19T08:58:00.675000+00:00,Same as above. But it will be good to ask 'how easy was it to find (insert element here)'. What do you like about this page? What do you think could be improved?
7954,2021-01-19T08:49:08.056000+00:00,What do you want to know?
7955,2021-01-19T08:48:52.556000+00:00,"Kind of depends on what kind of feedback you're looking for, are you looking for feedback or are you testing a design?"
7956,2021-01-19T08:35:56.350000+00:00,How do you guys decide the best question for feedback? I want to send some landing page designs and get some feedback on them but I don't know what will be the best questions to ask.
7957,2021-01-18T14:52:39.803000+00:00,"Got it, will do. Thanks for the reminder :)"

7961,2021-01-18T07:53:28.759000+00:00,You want conclusions based on raw data
7962,2021-01-17T18:01:44.485000+00:00,depends how much the user survey data helped you form a problem statement or if it helped more in the actual design. It's good to think the big picture how much the data from the survey impacted the entire process
7963,2021-01-17T18:00:18.202000+00:00,Should I break it out into its own section or can I build it into the problem statement area?
7964,2021-01-17T17:51:04.107000+00:00,"Couple of suggestions, pick out the highlight stats or responses in copy i.e. 75% of respondents felt this.

Also pick out quotes if you have any and present them in larger text with nice font and ""..."" etc. Hope some of those suggestions help!"
7965,2021-01-17T17:48:29.092000+00:00,This is my first time putting a user survey in a case study. Whats best practices for showing it? Should I just use the raw data to build infographics?

7968,2021-01-16T08:33:00.559000+00:00,"Copy Writing is different, and should only be done if you enjoy writing text (or I guess just want to do intern experience)"
7969,2021-01-16T08:31:57.633000+00:00,Well if you want to do UX research experience you should try to see if you can apply to such a position.

Both of them aren't very involved in the UX research process (at least the UX writers I've worked with, there might be roles where you are)."

7993,2021-01-13T11:41:21.274000+00:00,"I would say no there üòÖ  it's not very difficult to find 5 users for a remote user test though, feel free to use <#708809627260944436> on here"
7994,2021-01-13T11:41:02.690000+00:00,"EHm well, you can, but it's a bit fraudy"
7995,2021-01-13T11:39:54.709000+00:00,"It's hard to explain, but I would love to do real UXR as part of my real job, but when I am beginning without actual real data, and users, can I say for example I've done Usability Testing with 5 users, without actually doing it?"
7996,2021-01-13T11:32:23.806000+00:00,"I think the challenge of the empathy map (or persona for that matter) is not filling in the blanks, but getting the right information through research."
7997,2021-01-13T11:31:36.929000+00:00,Then why have an empathy map at all?
7998,2021-01-13T11:30:08.775000+00:00,"For example I have empathy map, and I know it's worthless without actual contact with people."
7999,2021-01-13T11:26:28.564000+00:00,"Like, faking an interview?"
8000,2021-01-13T11:26:19.239000+00:00,What do you mean by fake research?
8001,2021-01-13T11:24:58.308000+00:00,"Is it okay to do fake ux Research in personal case study, like interviews?"
8002,2021-01-12T10:57:11.099000+00:00,"that sort of thing would be a little hard to pull off.. can you share a censored prototype or mockup of your interface to better understand? or you could also use tools like Hotjar, Fullstory... integrate them in your live code for about a month to better understand possible reasons for off-boarding"
8003,2021-01-12T09:53:50.807000+00:00,Oh they do have a free trial though but the credit card barrier is to remove abuse of the trials. Although there is a free tier with no credit card the company obviously wants me to push for a free trial with credit details
8004,2021-01-12T09:49:20.049000+00:00,probably giving them a trial at the start or an bare bones minimal interactive session instead of a barely describing the functionality would be a better way to help them understand or determine the value of the application.. paying for something that they haven't interacted with or are not familiar with a clear no-go for anyone
8005,2021-01-12T09:27:37.319000+00:00,Have you tried testing it face to face?
8006,2021-01-11T23:24:44.062000+00:00,"have seen apps that just say ""login/sign up."" What am I signing up for? idk."
8007,2021-01-11T22:41:09.972000+00:00,My main goal right now is to increase on-boarding efficiency without  compromising user expectations
8008,2021-01-11T22:40:35.781000+00:00,Yeah so as Richard mention the onboarding currently has 3 screens that barely describe the app functionality and then the user creates a account which does require a credit card but for some reason people don't even get to the account making process 40% of the time
8009,2021-01-11T17:15:33.283000+00:00,Look at where and why people are dropping off during onboarding
8010,2021-01-11T17:14:34.355000+00:00,onboarding is a crutch for poor usability. Increase usability -> reduce onboarding proportionally ->
8011,2021-01-11T17:11:26.999000+00:00,"As Richard and Maggie alluded to, we can also discuss things in the specifics if you're able to share data or the context of when users predominantly drop off."
8012,2021-01-11T17:08:16.151000+00:00,"https://useronboard.com has lots of good teardowns of popular products.
https://pageflows.com is similar but gates a lot of content behind a paywall"
8013,2021-01-11T16:55:47.713000+00:00,"oooff yea, it can honestly be various things. They might be dropping off because on-boarding is too long, you're not being detailed enough, you're asking for information upfront (unnecessarily) or even that the onboarding is weird"
8014,2021-01-11T16:42:25.222000+00:00,"maybe further explaining your onboarding process can bring some insights, I've read that usually asking credit card details upfront usually reduces the potential for users to join in, for some product where the server cost is expensive, this could instead be a nice strategy to maintain a paying customer without burden on cost... so it completely depends on the product"
8015,2021-01-11T14:57:21.861000+00:00,"Hey guys, so a analysis of the app I'm working on shows that a lot of users are dropping off on the on boarding steps. So I am working on optimizing the onboarding process.  Any relevant resources for that?"
8016,2021-01-09T09:35:14.261000+00:00,"Haha, a nice example of rubber ducking üòÑ"
8017,2021-01-09T09:34:22.577000+00:00,Happy I could help!!
8018,2021-01-09T09:34:02.684000+00:00,Thanks a ton <@!586748131199287317> I'll speak to him this monday... ü§ó  this has been very fruitful
8019,2021-01-09T09:33:32.454000+00:00,It‚Äôs also more informal which would allow you to reach them better as formal methods are heavily filtered
8020,2021-01-09T09:33:14.522000+00:00,That could work
8021,2021-01-09T09:32:54.959000+00:00,maybe I can ask my CEO to bring along his colleagues and stuff
8022,2021-01-09T09:32:39.294000+00:00,hmmm.. well this tickles an idea
8023,2021-01-09T09:32:13.357000+00:00,If you have one person who is corporative maybe ask if they have any mates in similar positions
8024,2021-01-09T09:31:51.199000+00:00,can't lure them with gift card either lol
8025,2021-01-09T09:31:50.089000+00:00,"Good luck, it may take a while"
8026,2021-01-09T09:31:41.697000+00:00,Let's see in coming months how things go
8027,2021-01-09T09:31:17.981000+00:00,Okay fair enough
8028,2021-01-09T09:31:12.353000+00:00,Oooh
8029,2021-01-09T09:31:09.755000+00:00,Medium sized over large
8030,2021-01-09T09:31:06.683000+00:00,üòÖ product isn't for smaller ones.. it's B2B
8031,2021-01-09T09:30:46.066000+00:00,Maybe smaller businesses?
8032,2021-01-09T09:30:25.154000+00:00,They are only open to talk about their own business... not about the problems
8033,2021-01-09T09:30:21.544000+00:00,Especially with restrictions
8034,2021-01-09T09:29:45.363000+00:00,Totally
8035,2021-01-09T09:29:40.444000+00:00,interviews right now seems very hard to do
8036,2021-01-09T09:29:33.290000+00:00,and we have taken up Fullstory product to better understand user behavior
8037,2021-01-09T09:29:17.036000+00:00,So in 1 month after lots of emails back and forth we only got 2 CEOs to talk.. so I was instead directed the Customer Success team to talk to current clients and note down what they say and gather info from them
8038,2021-01-09T09:29:10.663000+00:00,Thank you for the advice!!
8039,2021-01-09T09:28:40.480000+00:00,Lots of CEO business cards around
8040,2021-01-09T09:28:31.881000+00:00,Did you collect phone numbers?
8041,2021-01-09T09:28:16.747000+00:00,"I did read that asking personal questions like what's your fav xyz, how's your day.. etc before the interview really helps them open up"
8042,2021-01-09T09:27:41.510000+00:00,What have you done so far Richard?
8043,2021-01-09T09:27:27.399000+00:00,"Being a student, people are more willing to accept"
8044,2021-01-09T09:27:19.462000+00:00,I think I also have a handicap
8045,2021-01-09T09:26:55.782000+00:00,Oh god
8046,2021-01-09T09:26:42.507000+00:00,My target user is actually CEOs and CHROs.. because our product is for them.. but then they are the most busiest.. only few find time
8047,2021-01-09T09:26:12.155000+00:00,What type of user are you looking for RIchard?
8048,2021-01-09T09:25:59.427000+00:00,I find people want to talk about themselves but feel odd about it
8049,2021-01-09T09:25:48.612000+00:00,They have an access card to get around <:sus:697917149385195522>
8050,2021-01-09T09:25:36.980000+00:00,I find that often people want to be interviewed
8051,2021-01-09T09:25:24.667000+00:00,THey get to talk the craziest people in the world
8052,2021-01-09T09:25:03.119000+00:00,"I don't know, do what a journalist doesüòµ"
8053,2021-01-09T09:23:51.252000+00:00,Dario what‚Äôs your secret
8054,2021-01-09T09:23:27.305000+00:00,Gathering people is always hard
8055,2021-01-09T09:23:26.596000+00:00,There are sites where you can pay for participants but those are for prototypes .. not like a one to one conversation based
8056,2021-01-09T09:22:50.547000+00:00,Yea .. personal indepth ones
8057,2021-01-09T09:22:07.245000+00:00,For interviews you mean?
8058,2021-01-09T09:21:22.461000+00:00,I see.. a problem I am currently facing is that I have a limited number of people around and do not wish to take the same people for survey... thought you might have this figured out
8059,2021-01-09T09:21:04.252000+00:00,Then see if I can build a network
8060,2021-01-09T09:20:55.328000+00:00,"""DO you know someone who totally disagrees with you?"""
8061,2021-01-09T09:20:46.463000+00:00,And always ask things like
8062,2021-01-09T09:20:22.202000+00:00,"But for my current project I'm at a company, so I just use MS teams üòÇ"
8063,2021-01-09T09:19:56.086000+00:00,"Well, people pay for the experience indeed. For example, people will regret when they order food, but  not when they sit and eat at the same place"
8064,2021-01-09T09:19:46.350000+00:00,Still cool
8065,2021-01-09T09:19:33.070000+00:00,Or keeping up images perhaps
8066,2021-01-09T09:19:14.810000+00:00,or more like u are more likely to spend money together with people. like going for meals together instead of cooking together
8067,2021-01-09T09:19:12.218000+00:00,"Oh no, this was done a year ago or so!"
8068,2021-01-09T09:19:11.421000+00:00,Well makes sense as we are experiential people
8069,2021-01-09T09:18:59.937000+00:00,Great job tbh
8070,2021-01-09T09:18:55.316000+00:00,But also a bit of a feelign to please their friends. Wanting to have a better experience.
8071,2021-01-09T09:18:53.747000+00:00,Really cool stuff Dario
8072,2021-01-09T09:18:45.137000+00:00,I really wonder how do you find new people for the surveys during pandemic
8073,2021-01-09T09:18:44.685000+00:00,peer pressure. lolol
8074,2021-01-09T09:18:12.378000+00:00,Are you at an institute right now?
8075,2021-01-09T09:18:07.906000+00:00,"May be different things. A shared experience with another person, therefore it contributes to social relationships with another person. WIlling to spend more because of that."
8076,2021-01-09T09:16:32.581000+00:00,"Oh that is interesting, why do you think that is"
8077,2021-01-09T09:16:04.527000+00:00,Money is more likely to spend socially. So when people are together they suddenly spend more money. (more of an observation)
8078,2021-01-09T09:14:58.658000+00:00,ANother interesting insight:
8079,2021-01-09T09:14:35.530000+00:00,I like to ask random people
8080,2021-01-09T09:14:19.817000+00:00,Just people I found around the building and ask them to sit with me
8081,2021-01-09T09:14:14.968000+00:00,Super interesting stuff
8082,2021-01-09T09:14:09.996000+00:00,Ah wow I‚Äôve only done similar techniques in a focus group setting
8083,2021-01-09T09:13:55.476000+00:00,Not really a focus group I suppose.
8084,2021-01-09T09:13:39.236000+00:00,Nope
8085,2021-01-09T09:13:35.299000+00:00,"So the money / value perception was depended on the item for each person, but there was always something"
8086,2021-01-09T09:13:02.511000+00:00,"The insights were that a lot of people who don't care about buying expensive clothes (for example), will suddenly care about buying expensive technology"
8087,2021-01-09T09:12:51.095000+00:00,Was this in a focus group btw
8088,2021-01-09T09:12:50.878000+00:00,<:PanWhoa:697917149687316551>
8089,2021-01-09T09:12:14.972000+00:00,The green line is: How much do they spend relative to the item. Yellow is how much they desire to spend. The Y line is amount of times the cost is spend
8090,2021-01-09T09:11:41.963000+00:00,How were the insights
8091,2021-01-09T09:11:37.067000+00:00,Very creative
8092,2021-01-09T09:11:34.601000+00:00,I like that
8093,2021-01-09T09:11:32.523000+00:00,Oh that‚Äôs super cool
8094,2021-01-09T09:11:03.180000+00:00,They themselves fill in the graphs while talking about it
8095,2021-01-09T09:10:53.946000+00:00,
8096,2021-01-09T09:10:50.261000+00:00,This was one for spending money
8097,2021-01-09T09:10:27.681000+00:00,Ahhh like some of the techniques in focus groups?
8098,2021-01-09T09:10:13.605000+00:00,I think I mainly tried alternative methods. Lots of drawings etc
8099,2021-01-09T09:10:02.668000+00:00,That's also a nice method!
8100,2021-01-09T09:09:57.647000+00:00,Ahh I wish I could speak multiple languages you are so lucky
8101,2021-01-09T09:09:02.912000+00:00,"i tried collecting data from people who didnt speak english well too, and i just talked to them in their native language first. hahahaha, and told them it's okay to use the language to replace the english words they dont know. more about giving them a relaxed atmosphere and they struggle with english less. since it's the data i care about, not their grammar/vocabulary."
8102,2021-01-09T09:06:27.426000+00:00,Ahh I interviewed native Chinese people in Australia
8103,2021-01-09T09:06:06.671000+00:00,I find that they know what they want to say but struggle to find the words
8104,2021-01-09T09:05:42.920000+00:00,"Yeah! With my study we went to barcelona, we had to interview people that didn't speak English well, while still collecting data"
8105,2021-01-09T09:05:40.758000+00:00,I‚Äôm just 158 and excitable
8106,2021-01-09T09:05:30.385000+00:00,That sounds fun
8107,2021-01-09T09:05:25.390000+00:00,ASMR interviews
8108,2021-01-09T09:05:11.914000+00:00,"I don't think I look very intimidating either, I've been told I have an ASMR voice. So I guess that can help"
8109,2021-01-09T09:04:32.007000+00:00,Also non-fluent english speakers
8110,2021-01-09T09:04:19.701000+00:00,Totally
8111,2021-01-09T09:04:04.426000+00:00,"Always difficult when someone only responds with one word, especially teenagers are like that"
8112,2021-01-09T09:03:21.161000+00:00,I also do think I look like the worlds most un-intimating person in rl so think that helps too
8113,2021-01-09T09:02:57.780000+00:00,"Oh yes, that does sound awkward indeed! D:"
8114,2021-01-09T09:02:02.420000+00:00,Then in the same interview had people who answer one word to everything
8115,2021-01-09T09:01:33.855000+00:00,I‚Äôve had people just ||randomly tell me about childhood trauma in interviews||
8116,2021-01-09T09:01:15.919000+00:00,You kinda have to adapt the techniques depending on how people respond
8117,2021-01-09T09:00:54.178000+00:00,Totally
8118,2021-01-09T09:00:37.678000+00:00,"Yes, though sometimes it gets a little awkward; 
Q""Why do you want to network?"" 
A""Because otherwise I'll lose my job."" 
Q""Why does that matter to you?"" 
A""..."""
8119,2021-01-09T08:58:12.043000+00:00,I‚Äôm a massive semi structured interview girl so those techniques are great
8120,2021-01-09T08:57:39.969000+00:00,Ooh laddering is fun
8121,2021-01-09T08:57:01.649000+00:00,For qualitative I especially enjoy laddering
8122,2021-01-09T08:56:34.285000+00:00,It‚Äôs a better approximation of the true experience
8123,2021-01-09T08:56:26.158000+00:00,"Yeah, it's always important I suppose"
8124,2021-01-09T08:56:15.092000+00:00,I prefer qualitative but I like backing it up with quant
8125,2021-01-09T08:55:57.207000+00:00,I‚Äôm getting trauma thinking about it
8126,2021-01-09T08:55:44.269000+00:00,Oh god you have no idea
8127,2021-01-09T08:55:37.814000+00:00,WHich is why I tend to stay at qualitative
8128,2021-01-09T08:55:24.211000+00:00,So luckily I don't need all that math knowledge
8129,2021-01-09T08:55:11.258000+00:00,At my current place we have the data scientist to do that for us in Python üòÇ
8130,2021-01-09T08:54:47.439000+00:00,Trash
8131,2021-01-09T08:54:43.545000+00:00,Lmao I remember when I had to manually type data sets for uni
8132,2021-01-09T08:54:39.072000+00:00,Or type 2 only I think
8133,2021-01-09T08:54:25.721000+00:00,Oh yeah with small sizes
8134,2021-01-09T08:54:14.950000+00:00,It only shows a prediction of that experience
8135,2021-01-09T08:54:03.663000+00:00,Lots of type 1 and type 2 errors with small sizes
8136,2021-01-09T08:53:59.438000+00:00,And data can not replicate that
8137,2021-01-09T08:53:50.233000+00:00,But then when your designing for experiences you need to understand the human experience
8138,2021-01-09T08:52:52.883000+00:00,Quantitative data is more a prediction machine then anything
8139,2021-01-09T08:52:42.205000+00:00,So I agree with you but also in the same regard dont
8140,2021-01-09T08:52:27.850000+00:00,Idk I also come from a data analytics  background
8141,2021-01-09T08:51:19.740000+00:00,"If 100 people answer to the survey, at 1000 it will suddenly be completely different result."
8142,2021-01-09T08:50:41.601000+00:00,Yeah I guess it depends sometimes
8143,2021-01-09T08:48:10.380000+00:00,*Like 60% of X. did not do this*
8144,2021-01-09T08:47:53.896000+00:00,"I find surveys are good but as supporting research, as quantitative research helps tell a good narrative when explaining something"
8145,2021-01-09T08:47:01.662000+00:00,There would always be one in at least one data set
8146,2021-01-09T08:46:42.300000+00:00,Yeah totally I also like to account for people who just ... don‚Äôt give good answers
8147,2021-01-09T08:45:41.291000+00:00,Only if the 5 people I found are the same type of people / fit in the same persona
8148,2021-01-09T08:45:31.723000+00:00,I also notice 5 interviews usually aren't enough
8149,2021-01-09T08:45:10.129000+00:00,"So I do deskresearch + field, then iterate between those"
8150,2021-01-09T08:44:49.312000+00:00,"Yeah, I usually don't have the amount of people for quantitative"
8151,2021-01-09T08:40:54.364000+00:00,It ensures qualitive research is backed up by quantitative means
8152,2021-01-09T08:39:51.519000+00:00,Yeah that‚Äôs why I like triangulation as a research technique
8153,2021-01-09T08:11:02.034000+00:00,Depending on how large the target democratic is
8154,2021-01-09T08:09:01.371000+00:00,Survey are more like 10k people to be useful üòÇ
8155,2021-01-08T21:57:13.053000+00:00,I find observation produces more of a natural flow
8156,2021-01-08T21:56:02.432000+00:00,"Although think out loud brings good results. When I apply it to regular people, I find they often feel awkward or just stop saying what they are doing half way through the process"
8157,2021-01-08T21:54:34.654000+00:00,I prefer a more user observation + post test interview.
8158,2021-01-08T21:32:49.128000+00:00,"For usability studies, how do you guys word talk-aloud protocol to your participants? When I am a participant I tend to read everything on the screen explicitly and it feels like I am not using it like I would normally. I am worried that it might give me  This is what I have in my script now, ""Instruct them to speak what they are thinking and their thought process behind what they are going to do."" Would it be more appropriate to ask probing questions when they do anything or just when they do something that goes against my hypothesis or whenever they do something that is out of the norm. To get them using it more like they would IRL."
8159,2021-01-08T21:01:44.387000+00:00,"I understand, the points you've mentioned totally make sense. I'll be sure to check out the resource you've shared. Thanks again for the helpful feedback <@!181895166460690432>!"
8160,2021-01-08T19:51:36.547000+00:00,"nope, surveys and interviews don't necessarily go hand in hand, that just depends on the reasons I mentioned above. Interviews are helpful more so in the beginning of a project because you're trying to discover pain points and understand behaviors that will eventually lead you data you can use to design and prototype. ""Interviews"" after making a prototype are more so usability tests and at that point you're trying to validate/invalidate an idea, but that idea should be based on previous and solid research. Research takes many forms during the design process, it's not a one-and-done, it's essentially how we keep the user involved throughout the entire process.

For more context, basically I'm doing a personal product design challenge where I'll be designing a new feature for Lyft. So right now I'm in the early research phase to have a better understanding of the people who currently use the app. For user research, I thought surveys and user interviews went hand in hand, so I would have to do both (but maybe not). Perhaps I should wait until the prototyping phase of my project to conduct user interviews instead."
8162,2021-01-08T18:36:43.917000+00:00,"well sometimes surveys can be unnecessary as well - it depends on what your goals, restrictions, constraints, resources are"

8165,2021-01-08T18:29:31.667000+00:00,"So for interviews -> 5 people -> indepth meaningful conversation and questions

For survey -> 20/30 -> general questions that are not tiresome"
8166,2021-01-08T18:28:41.018000+00:00,"For survey you will need around 20-30 sample size, so having indepth questions for surveys might actually kill people's mood and might not answer your survey honestly or might dropoff.."
8167,2021-01-08T18:27:50.551000+00:00,For interview questions.. you only need a max of 5 participants and often run then through a demo or prototype of our work. Most of the problems that your users can face will be covered by these 5 itself

in the end it's all personal preference, i would roughly sketch on paper to iterate over the ideas and then move onto lofi to give it a good look and share with the team.

8224,2021-01-03T20:09:22.972000+00:00,fidelity only matters based on what the goals of the research are. Not all designs and concepts will benefit from low-fidelity.

8238,2021-01-03T16:01:31.666000+00:00,It's a fine line between making something that helps you to move forward with more understanding and building a really detailed prototype that might take you a long time.
8239,2021-01-03T16:00:07.179000+00:00,For sure! Having the concept ready to interact is a good way to see if your assumptions were right.

What is the point of a high fidelity wire-frame? Why not just do a detailed prototype? I'm not that artistic, so this is pretty time consuming for me; I would much whether be coding. 

I have started converting my low fidelity drawing wire-frames to digital, but I am struggling to understand why I should take the time to do this step. Is it really that important?"

and we are group are student who are trying to mimic teh whole process
Now are stuck with Day 1 .
Note - N - Map
Should i solve all problem in this sprint or should i only stick to once feature (we will not do development, So we taught we can take six features for redesign)

8373,2020-12-17T09:49:09.739000+00:00,"sorry wish i could help more, hopefully someone else with more expertise will come along"
8374,2020-12-17T09:48:40.391000+00:00,oh man üò¶
8375,2020-12-17T09:46:41.532000+00:00,"We usually market to users that we know have some interest in the product (using FB and google ads), we also get some redirects that are high quality leads.
Almost all the users I have talked with have been happy and have cited the product as something that meets their expectations. 
On the marketing front, maybe we don't use the appropriate techniques? I have little to no idea on marketing conversions. Any resources to study that?"
8376,2020-12-17T09:42:00.361000+00:00,are they in your target market?
8377,2020-12-17T09:41:56.430000+00:00,where are the website visitors coming from?
8378,2020-12-17T09:41:48.054000+00:00,"hmm
yes there is demand for the product but how well does the product meet the demand? 
also, maybe marketing"
8379,2020-12-17T09:39:27.324000+00:00,The designs I have work on paper but as soon as put in the real world they unexpectedly under-perform
8380,2020-12-17T09:37:09.509000+00:00,"We know that there is a demand for the product, interviews with the current users proves that. And yes the % conversions is well below the industry average"
8381,2020-12-17T09:35:53.549000+00:00,"idk much about this topic but i would want to know: 
is the conversion rate significantly below the norm compared to similar products/competitors in the same industry? (not sure if you would be able to check that) 
is it the product itself that is not appealing?"
8382,2020-12-17T09:32:19.806000+00:00,"Hey guys! So I am design the landing page of my company's product and even though I followed most of the conventions for increasing conversions, we are seemingly not getting result. I tried to troubleshoot the UX by watching session videos and asking some users but we can't seem to pinpoint any particular problem. How do you guys optimize your designs for conversions?"
8383,2020-12-16T10:22:08.413000+00:00,"yes, i agree!"
8384,2020-12-16T09:20:29.210000+00:00,That is an indirect feature
8385,2020-12-16T09:20:14.238000+00:00,They're talking about the user needs
8386,2020-12-16T09:20:03.939000+00:00,I always find that most UX designers should especially know how to manage features
8387,2020-12-16T09:19:35.959000+00:00,"Yeah, I guess you work together too!"
8388,2020-12-16T09:18:30.719000+00:00,I guess my point is a bit silly because managing backlog is deciding priority. Hmm
8389,2020-12-16T09:17:42.351000+00:00,But yeah
8390,2020-12-16T09:17:41.073000+00:00,"I see~ Sometimes it really depends on the company as well, as to how they assign responsibilites to roles"
8391,2020-12-16T09:17:40.497000+00:00,In my experience PMs end up doing much more backlog management than identifying what to build
8392,2020-12-16T09:14:57.271000+00:00,"However, not much about how much it should cost and all that stuff"
8393,2020-12-16T09:14:45.145000+00:00,Just research about 'why' and 'which' concept should exist
8394,2020-12-16T09:14:38.401000+00:00,some business strategy involved
8395,2020-12-16T09:14:13.085000+00:00,I've been doing that for the last few months actually
8396,2020-12-16T09:14:00.924000+00:00,"Ohhh, I think we need to do that as well"
8397,2020-12-16T09:11:29.908000+00:00,"Since the exact roles always differ depending on who you asking, haha, decided to take this one which matches what I'm thinking"
8398,2020-12-16T09:10:46.276000+00:00,"```A product manager is the person who identifies the customer need and the larger business objectives that a product or feature will fulfill, articulates what success looks like for a product, and rallies a team to turn that vision into a reality.``` - Atlassian definition"
8399,2020-12-16T09:08:35.731000+00:00,Based on UXR
8400,2020-12-16T09:08:31.566000+00:00,"As in, defining why the 'product' on itself is added value"
8401,2020-12-16T09:08:03.484000+00:00,On my study we're always the UX as well as the PM's
8402,2020-12-16T09:07:47.896000+00:00,What are the exact roles of a PM again?
8403,2020-12-16T09:07:31.382000+00:00,Ohhh
8404,2020-12-16T09:07:15.008000+00:00,Product Management
8405,2020-12-16T09:07:06.300000+00:00,PM?
8406,2020-12-16T09:06:56.765000+00:00,good for PM too!
8407,2020-12-16T09:06:46.806000+00:00,Choice architecture
8408,2020-12-16T09:06:34.239000+00:00,Doing a master in behavioral economics is also quite nice for UXR
8409,2020-12-16T08:37:42.293000+00:00,stumbled upon a new channel https://youtu.be/WPepMVD8XLM

8411,2020-12-16T05:21:21.822000+00:00,Thanks üôÇ
8412,2020-12-16T05:19:38.702000+00:00,"Not really, as MBA isnt really a research oriented degree. HCI, psych, anthropology, sociology are all closer in spirit and in methods to UXR."
8413,2020-12-15T21:15:31.108000+00:00,"Psychology also dives into the unconscious and conscious reasons to why users select or avoid certain things definitely helps you deliver pitching and ""empathize"" with the why more in case studies etc."

8415,2020-12-15T21:11:52.771000+00:00,<https://lawsofux.com/> here's a small example of some psychology terms used to describe design
8416,2020-12-15T21:09:00.750000+00:00,psychology might be your best route a lot of information is applied there in creative industries
8417,2020-12-15T21:05:02.514000+00:00,I like affinity diagramming but that‚Äôs probably not the best reason to go into UX research lol
8418,2020-12-15T21:04:37.703000+00:00,And then using findings to find meaningful data is cool üôÇ
8419,2020-12-15T21:04:15.883000+00:00,Hmm I just think learning about why people do things is interesting üòÇ
8420,2020-12-15T21:02:45.486000+00:00,interesting do you have any specific interests in research?
8421,2020-12-15T21:02:11.037000+00:00,that's good! we don't have a program like that just design with a few ui/ux courses. from here I'd have to look at extracurriculars
8422,2020-12-15T21:02:05.791000+00:00,Bc I‚Äôm leaning towards more UX research üòÆ
8423,2020-12-15T21:01:36.129000+00:00,I‚Äôm wondering if next year I should prepare applying for grad school
8424,2020-12-15T21:01:16.774000+00:00,We do a lot of HCI stuff already for coursework üò∂
8425,2020-12-15T21:01:02.791000+00:00,Hmm my undergrad is pretty niche
8426,2020-12-15T21:00:57.702000+00:00,"I think if I was able to do a masters I would do HCI, but I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs necessary for me... I do miss school though so if it‚Äôs free üëÄ"
8427,2020-12-15T20:58:20.173000+00:00,"If I were to go beyond undergrad, it would to expand my Anthropology"
8428,2020-12-15T20:58:14.617000+00:00,Double degree <:PanWhoa:697917149687316551>
8429,2020-12-15T20:57:49.988000+00:00,Nice Anthropology mention in there. Doing a double degree in Anthro and Design.
8430,2020-12-15T20:51:06.655000+00:00,yea i think it could be useful in CX roles
8431,2020-12-15T20:50:50.618000+00:00,<@!700697880352129125> I don‚Äôt think necessary is the right word... Though I am sure certain that some higher positions ask that you have a masters... I don‚Äôt know much about the research side but to me they are more likely in asking for master degrees. You could probably do a LinkedIn search and see what senior level ux researchers have degrees in
8432,2020-12-15T20:50:33.176000+00:00,oh and i haven't even finished undergrad lmao
8433,2020-12-15T20:50:18.051000+00:00,maybe more on the strategy side? ngl i always thought it would be cool to get an mba. they are so expensive tho
8434,2020-12-15T20:47:22.706000+00:00,So would an MBA be necessary for some UX research roles?
8435,2020-12-15T20:46:56.296000+00:00,I never thought about business!
8436,2020-12-15T20:16:45.007000+00:00,"<@!700697880352129125> I think the UX field in particular is pretty open in terms of academia, so it would be interesting to find out what is at the top. I‚Äôm fairly sure business is another one."
8437,2020-12-15T20:13:53.120000+00:00,don't forget HCI
8438,2020-12-15T20:13:31.312000+00:00,"For UX research roles what are common masters degrees to have? For a lot of jobs I see psychology, cognitive science, or anthropology. Are there others?"
8439,2020-12-15T16:56:10.471000+00:00,"I'm doing alright - mostly designing today and the rest of the week...not so much research. I'm familiar with research because i have a master's in HCI, so most times, the designers i work with don't have a lot of research experience, so i end up helping out a lot, especially if the company doesn't have ux researchers. I'm technically a UX designer, but because of my background - I do both, but I miss working alongside a proper ux researcher...i could never do that job full time."
8440,2020-12-15T16:51:09.963000+00:00,"I was able to learn how to take better notes for next time. It was also validating to learn that my UX lense is on track, as in I was confident about solutioning and good at collecting detailed observations which made an impact during triage! So much to learn! 

How are you today Maggie? Are you moreso into the research aspect of things? Curious to know more about you! (And <@218928410263683073> if they're around) üòÖ"
8441,2020-12-15T16:49:00.028000+00:00,that's awesome to hear!
8442,2020-12-15T16:47:52.453000+00:00,Hey <@181895166460690432> it was a looooong class last night observing two users! Learned a lot and enjoyed myself. We watched our prof conduct a total of 6 tasks with each user and we followed up with triage afterwards which will be data for our report (last assignment). I loled a few times regarding ATC tasks.. but overall it was super chill and VA very digestible process üòä

8445,2020-12-14T22:20:53.843000+00:00,truly gotta love the invention of post-it notes LOL >.<

8447,2020-12-14T22:07:55.258000+00:00,"There is also a form of synthesis that is sometimes called ""___ bingo"" where feedback duplicates are discarded by the group before affinity diagramming. Basically the room takes turns saying what observation they made, and anyone who has the same observation passes that post-it to the first person. This will lead to discussion of notes pre-diagramming and will reduce the number of observations/insights in play, as well as give the entire room a collective understanding of what is being discussed."
8448,2020-12-14T22:05:28.400000+00:00,This article deeplinks into affinity diagramming: https://www.nngroup.com/articles/group-notetaking/
8449,2020-12-14T22:04:33.414000+00:00,This is a good overview of guidelines for being an observer

8451,2020-12-14T22:03:31.568000+00:00,"digitally you can collect feedback however you want, but your method should be considerate of how the feedback will be shared with the rest of the team."
8452,2020-12-14T22:03:04.848000+00:00,"In-person this usually looks like writing down small shorthand notes on individual post-its, as it makes moving around and organizing your notes much easier"
8453,2020-12-14T22:02:27.004000+00:00,"The industry accepted practice of being an observer is to take as many notes as you can during the study about what the participant is saying and doing, to make it easier to digest the feedback through synthesis methods such as affinity diagramming."
8454,2020-12-14T21:55:10.145000+00:00,"yea, if you're not conducting or leading, you're observing and taking notes üôÇ"
8455,2020-12-14T21:54:37.944000+00:00,this is helpful as i wasn't totally sure what more to observe.. these details are helpful thank you!
8456,2020-12-14T21:41:16.495000+00:00,Hey UX researchers! Do any of you have any recommendations to do remote user testing for apps? So far I've only tested prototypes or websites so I'm not really sure what the best way would be to do this for an already published app
8457,2020-12-14T21:28:25.668000+00:00,"ah cool, then in that case you're there to observe üòÑ take a lot of notes and pay attention to how the user behaves, what they say and how they say it. What do they react to?"
8458,2020-12-14T21:25:34.246000+00:00,let me get the details...

8467,2020-12-12T17:11:52.541000+00:00,hmmm yeah probably... or also maybe they are into sci-fi movies
8468,2020-12-12T16:58:56.929000+00:00,Then the hoax is just a cover up problem of the isolation problem
8469,2020-12-12T16:58:12.724000+00:00,Maybe they mainly think it's a hoax because being socially isolated is getting to their heads
8470,2020-12-12T16:57:34.033000+00:00,I guess more interestingly would be why they think it's a hoax
8471,2020-12-12T16:56:50.762000+00:00,But I guess people who actually think it's a full hoax isn't a big enough group to be a major issue

8476,2020-12-12T16:51:50.388000+00:00,There has been studies that when someone believes 1 conspiracy they'll believe more

8495,2020-12-12T16:43:13.509000+00:00,but you have to make sure they are still taken seriously üòÖ
8496,2020-12-12T16:43:12.433000+00:00,"Yeah, just realized while typing"
8497,2020-12-12T16:43:03.006000+00:00,stops you panicking
8498,2020-12-12T16:42:50.648000+00:00,Maybe that's why it's effective
8499,2020-12-12T16:42:43.170000+00:00,Is the fire drill effective though? I guess it usually makes people think a real fire is a drill üòÇ
8500,2020-12-12T16:42:07.500000+00:00,u know there are things like fire drills? maybe using a similar method?
8501,2020-12-12T16:41:36.462000+00:00,"yeah, i dont think it applies anyways, in terms of negative reinforcement. probably a conformity exercise helps"
8502,2020-12-12T16:41:35.795000+00:00,I think I need to find ways how to increase social responsibility
8503,2020-12-12T16:40:53.610000+00:00,for sure!
8504,2020-12-12T16:37:54.607000+00:00,"But still, less effective as a longterm strategy"
8505,2020-12-12T16:37:15.248000+00:00,I guess a human can üòÇ
8506,2020-12-12T16:35:44.953000+00:00,A dog doesn't learn to roll over by slapping him
8507,2020-12-12T16:35:05.194000+00:00,Also punishment is an easy solution I suppose
8508,2020-12-12T16:34:42.087000+00:00,"Yeah, can't do that in an office though"
8509,2020-12-12T16:34:24.437000+00:00,Using confederates should be fun!
8510,2020-12-12T16:22:41.658000+00:00,tbh i think my city still follows the rules due to fines being enforced.
8511,2020-12-12T16:22:04.633000+00:00,"hmm maybe conformity effect works, get some confederates with you"
8512,2020-12-12T16:06:46.551000+00:00,"I guess in groups, sometimes nobody keeps distance, because nobody feels responsible for being the one having to enforce it"
8513,2020-12-12T16:06:00.900000+00:00,I wonder if COVID-19 could be nudged like the by stander effect
8514,2020-12-10T06:11:51.534000+00:00,^^^^^do it

8516,2020-12-08T21:16:36.824000+00:00,It's not the technical term but still works
8517,2020-12-08T21:16:11.170000+00:00,thats not right
8518,2020-12-08T21:16:09.726000+00:00,and i was like
8519,2020-12-08T21:16:08.444000+00:00,my mind got stuck on disqualifying
8520,2020-12-08T21:15:48.772000+00:00,ya ty
8521,2020-12-08T21:15:36.004000+00:00,Exclusion criteria?
8522,2020-12-08T21:15:04.104000+00:00,üëÄ
8523,2020-12-08T21:14:55.456000+00:00,D: D:
8524,2020-12-08T21:14:51.730000+00:00,"theres a word for it, lol"
8525,2020-12-08T21:14:35.471000+00:00,what's the opposite of participant criteria in recruitment
8526,2020-12-08T21:14:24.696000+00:00,"help, my mind is blanking"
8527,2020-12-08T18:06:50.446000+00:00,"Ohh nice, I should try to see if I can get that :D!"
8528,2020-12-08T17:55:16.066000+00:00,you can get axure and protopie for free as a student
8529,2020-12-08T17:40:30.714000+00:00,"but assuming it actually works, it would take a few seconds to link up proximity to somethign like haptic feedback"
8530,2020-12-08T17:39:30.761000+00:00,I've never tried
8531,2020-12-08T17:39:20.669000+00:00,https://blog.protopie.io/prototype-with-sensors-in-protopie-73a0375e1128
8532,2020-12-08T17:39:16.554000+00:00,with iphones at least
8533,2020-12-08T17:38:53.879000+00:00,I think protopie will do proximity
8534,2020-12-08T17:38:48.816000+00:00,mmm
8535,2020-12-08T17:36:58.460000+00:00,To test behaviour response
8536,2020-12-08T17:36:48.536000+00:00,Kind of fake a sensor reading
8537,2020-12-08T17:36:43.728000+00:00,"Basically I want to do some testing in public spaces, when people get to close"
8538,2020-12-08T17:36:32.363000+00:00,"Nice, that will be very useful!"
8539,2020-12-08T17:23:16.331000+00:00,because protopie prototypes can send and receive to each other
8540,2020-12-08T17:21:41.902000+00:00,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IEYRYh1dKso
8541,2020-12-08T17:20:23.725000+00:00,but you can also trigger them from a second device
8542,2020-12-08T17:20:17.185000+00:00,protopie has key triggers
8543,2020-12-08T17:18:05.031000+00:00,next-gen prototypes
8544,2020-12-08T17:17:52.946000+00:00,"that's crazy, I had no idea"
8545,2020-12-08T17:09:08.877000+00:00,"I think key triggers would be best. I guess I would have like several videos made in after effects (5 or so), then be able to play the animations like a soundboard would play sounds"
8546,2020-12-08T17:06:10.179000+00:00,"XD actually supports voice triggers in prototypes, which might help?"
8547,2020-12-08T16:54:26.705000+00:00,To fake sensor reading
8548,2020-12-08T16:54:21.057000+00:00,In the ideal situation I would be able to control the prototype from a distance
8549,2020-12-08T16:54:07.736000+00:00,Thanks! I'll see if I can do something with that!
8550,2020-12-08T16:36:19.360000+00:00,"Just looking it up quickly, it looks like it's not an official XD feature that I can tell, but you __might__ be able to use the Anima plugin to add video: https://www.animaapp.com/xd"
8551,2020-12-08T16:28:56.663000+00:00,"or if you need to get a tiered sub to get the ""feature"""
8552,2020-12-08T16:28:45.974000+00:00,"It supposed to allow video and sound, but I don't quite remember if it's allowed on default"
8553,2020-12-08T16:27:33.638000+00:00,Not sure about that..I think it has a free trial though right? could always give it a try
8554,2020-12-08T16:27:03.660000+00:00,Do they display videos though?

8556,2020-12-08T16:12:08.874000+00:00,Adobe XD seems to have key triggers?
8557,2020-12-08T16:10:55.298000+00:00,"there's probably another one you're thinking of, i'm just not sure which one"
8558,2020-12-08T16:10:34.359000+00:00,"unfortunately no, it's kinda pricey üò¨ ."
8559,2020-12-08T16:06:07.296000+00:00,Is Axure a free one?
8560,2020-12-08T16:02:05.464000+00:00,"not sure exactly what you're thinking of, but you could definitely make that in Axure"
8561,2020-12-08T15:58:12.494000+00:00,Does anyone know the name of this?
8562,2020-12-08T15:57:42.787000+00:00,"For example, you can make 5 animations and keybind them with a keyboard, ""K"" ""P"" etc"
8563,2020-12-08T15:57:14.904000+00:00,There's specific prototype software where you can keybind looped videos
8564,2020-12-08T15:56:50.422000+00:00,Heyo! Question
8565,2020-12-06T06:03:54.468000+00:00,Sorry! Got it! Just deleted
8566,2020-12-06T06:02:23.812000+00:00,seconding to what <@!700697880352129125> said - this channel is only for discussing UX research and methodologies!
8567,2020-12-06T06:01:15.872000+00:00,Hi <@679403122019532831> could you please move your post to the <#708809627260944436> channel? This is where many members post UX research studies üôÇ
8568,2020-12-05T22:17:42.362000+00:00,"Does anyone use any measurements to convert your grids into ""pixels""?"
8569,2020-12-05T22:17:08.979000+00:00,I cant really lay down my monitor and sketch on it.
8570,2020-12-05T22:16:15.683000+00:00,but for webspages
8571,2020-12-05T22:15:33.286000+00:00,thank you

8573,2020-12-05T22:14:43.985000+00:00,"that kind of thing, what I have used when I've done wireframing in the past :)"
8574,2020-12-05T22:13:48.747000+00:00,you can make them 1:1 on paper and sketch on top of the actual screen size you are using :)
8575,2020-12-05T22:13:34.832000+00:00,I would print out templates
8576,2020-12-05T22:13:26.523000+00:00,I would like to make more accurate sketches
8577,2020-12-05T22:10:11.636000+00:00,are you trying to do high-res sketching?
8578,2020-12-05T22:09:53.117000+00:00,while sketching?
8579,2020-12-05T22:06:58.518000+00:00,when sketching out screens how do you make sure that what you are sketching is the right size? or the right proportions?
8580,2020-12-03T21:12:04.293000+00:00,recruiting like...
8581,2020-12-02T01:02:55.372000+00:00,"What questions do you all have about UX research that I should address in my new book?
Also if there are any mentors and professionals willing to share their experience and insights in an interview, please tag me and let me know your interest."
8582,2020-12-01T21:56:16.875000+00:00,Definitely some other useful info in those as well :)
8583,2020-12-01T21:55:55.187000+00:00,Thanks for all the messages!
8584,2020-12-01T21:55:43.905000+00:00,Haha I have a good idea what I‚Äôm doing next then
8585,2020-12-01T21:50:49.353000+00:00,Yeah definitely I think
8586,2020-12-01T21:44:57.576000+00:00,making these *per use case* seems useful.
8587,2020-12-01T21:44:10.237000+00:00,so I could pick some here that would fit the persona?
8588,2020-12-01T21:43:45.118000+00:00,I did collect a bunch of customer jobs - by going through actual things people were saying
8589,2020-12-01T21:43:24.539000+00:00,I think personas bring their gain with latent needs especially
8590,2020-12-01T21:42:20.457000+00:00,"Yeah, often they are"
8591,2020-12-01T21:20:14.434000+00:00,(It's not like I  have those exact ones on there yet anyway)
8592,2020-12-01T21:19:24.004000+00:00,"these 3 elements could already appear right on the persona profiles, right?"
8593,2020-12-01T21:18:48.889000+00:00,"hm, nice"
8594,2020-12-01T21:13:30.756000+00:00,The right side
8595,2020-12-01T21:13:28.795000+00:00,
8596,2020-12-01T21:13:04.069000+00:00,"If you're not looking to seperate values etc though or latent needs, a value proposition canvas could work nice as well"
8597,2020-12-01T21:00:24.085000+00:00,I could get away with just two! combining the last 2
8598,2020-12-01T20:42:02.821000+00:00,-someone mostly using social media sites that would be more interested in the collaboration aspect.
8599,2020-12-01T20:41:20.600000+00:00,"-someone using the browser mostly for visual inspiration, references, videos, that might currently be saving things on the respective platforms (instagram save, pinterest, yt watch later...)"
8600,2020-12-01T20:40:24.545000+00:00,"-someone using the browser for in depth research, connecting what they find, referencing it"
8601,2020-12-01T20:39:53.714000+00:00,so my personas are
8602,2020-12-01T20:39:49.182000+00:00,"I'm making a browser prototype where things are organized differently than with tabs, simple bookmarks and history. 
That would be useful for research, but could be useful for many people, if the alternative is good -"
8603,2020-12-01T20:38:24.085000+00:00,I'll sum up the personas thing if there's any more thoughts on that
8604,2020-12-01T20:38:08.015000+00:00,anyway:
8605,2020-12-01T20:37:23.021000+00:00,so quite different from just zooming anywhere in figma or miro
8606,2020-12-01T20:37:09.336000+00:00,"well, besides locking it to one direction currently, everything is also in nested boards"
8607,2020-12-01T20:36:37.516000+00:00,"""But our experiments have shown that this starts to break down as you add more directions of freedom. The user quickly finds themselves disoriented, like floating in an endless white void."""
8608,2020-12-01T20:35:29.911000+00:00,"Nice ,looks cool!"
8609,2020-12-01T20:31:41.379000+00:00,bit related
8610,2020-12-01T20:31:21.735000+00:00,"lol, I just saw this perhaps an hour ago https://museapp.com/memos/2020-12-infinite-canvas/"
8611,2020-12-01T20:29:26.540000+00:00,"well, actual pen and paper would be haha"
8612,2020-12-01T20:29:17.661000+00:00,if you're only taking notes with apple pencil....that's like the other extreme
8613,2020-12-01T20:28:36.224000+00:00,"like if there's explicit boards, like sub pages"
8614,2020-12-01T20:28:08.072000+00:00,It's interesting to think about how more rigid structures the computer can do more with
8615,2020-12-01T20:28:03.916000+00:00,"Made like a whole structure, but felt like a chore eventually"
8616,2020-12-01T20:27:36.261000+00:00,I just didn't come back for it
8617,2020-12-01T20:27:25.105000+00:00,But
8618,2020-12-01T20:27:24.056000+00:00,Useful*
8619,2020-12-01T20:27:19.336000+00:00,I thought Notion was big
8620,2020-12-01T20:26:40.679000+00:00,"So there could be, say, an artist collecting reference images and tutorials and such"
8621,2020-12-01T20:26:26.550000+00:00,x10 more effective than notion
8622,2020-12-01T20:26:24.866000+00:00,"then another focus is making things more spatial, easy to orient yourself in, more like Miro/Figma and perhaps pinterest/are.na"
8623,2020-12-01T20:26:13.587000+00:00,miro is amazing I use it to plan routines
8624,2020-12-01T20:25:07.854000+00:00,"Okay so just to get back to this for a second, I have one persona specifically using it like you described"
8625,2020-12-01T20:23:01.971000+00:00,I know of some iOS/Mac only things but use a Windows pc
8626,2020-12-01T20:22:46.145000+00:00,ooo
8627,2020-12-01T20:22:41.217000+00:00,My Miro gets big
8628,2020-12-01T20:22:39.711000+00:00,
8629,2020-12-01T20:22:18.153000+00:00,"If they sort of embed like on Discord, that sounds great"
8630,2020-12-01T20:21:52.628000+00:00,did not try putting links in Miro though <:11eyes:714281258045276164>
8631,2020-12-01T20:21:40.341000+00:00,I do so much stuff right in Figma
8632,2020-12-01T20:21:33.131000+00:00,same
8633,2020-12-01T20:21:30.153000+00:00,I like the whiteboard format
8634,2020-12-01T20:21:26.346000+00:00,"like - if you just paste a link, it won't show up nicely with a title and so on right away"
8635,2020-12-01T20:21:26.118000+00:00,Notion is too structured for me
8636,2020-12-01T20:21:09.307000+00:00,in Notion
8637,2020-12-01T20:21:06.490000+00:00,Their bookmarks are annyoing
8638,2020-12-01T20:21:00.072000+00:00,Now I put everything down in Miro
8639,2020-12-01T20:20:55.414000+00:00,"I used notion before, but stopped doing that"
8640,2020-12-01T20:20:52.320000+00:00,"reference managers, social bookmarking..."
8641,2020-12-01T20:20:42.682000+00:00,I have a big Notion page with relevant extensions and so on that already take this a lot further
8642,2020-12-01T20:20:20.366000+00:00,So what bookmarks and open tabs and history sort of do
8643,2020-12-01T20:20:03.093000+00:00,"Well - taking more away from what you find, collecting, saving, organizing, taking notes"
8644,2020-12-01T20:19:41.262000+00:00,"haha, I guess that's what everyone does on google."
8645,2020-12-01T20:19:25.116000+00:00,"So more like ""Search"" then I suppose?"
8646,2020-12-01T20:19:05.443000+00:00,"so it's not ""for students"" per se"
8647,2020-12-01T20:18:45.309000+00:00,"Oh, when I said using the browser for research, I'm also thinking of looking at a bunch of pages to find the solution for some tech problem, learning a hobby, and generally collecting things like informative videos, books, recipes, inspiration...."
8648,2020-12-01T20:17:10.466000+00:00,Which already doesn't work if you need to remember exactly what came from where instead of one big list of references at the end
8649,2020-12-01T20:15:57.004000+00:00,"It's not as formal, but for a presentation I was just keeping all the tabs open, lol"
8650,2020-12-01T20:15:27.932000+00:00,Do you do anything to get notes and whatever you are referencing in the same place?
8651,2020-12-01T20:14:15.947000+00:00,<:worried_smile:744236837555404899>
8652,2020-12-01T20:13:58.493000+00:00,Then I'm spending several hours connecting all research to the paper / source
8653,2020-12-01T20:13:33.461000+00:00,"Then one problem I personally have with APA referencing, is that I always do it too late <:lmoa:697917150131781705>"
8654,2020-12-01T20:13:29.472000+00:00,yup!
8655,2020-12-01T20:13:01.806000+00:00,The process of doing research > Finding Refs > turning it into APA etc
8656,2020-12-01T20:12:36.677000+00:00,Wouldn't that be a Journey on its own
8657,2020-12-01T20:12:13.498000+00:00,people using it for research
8658,2020-12-01T20:11:56.197000+00:00,yeah
8659,2020-12-01T20:11:53.725000+00:00,I do already have more of a focus than that I suppose
8660,2020-12-01T20:11:48.778000+00:00,I guess only those close to the problem you're trying to solve
8661,2020-12-01T20:11:33.811000+00:00,"haha, right."
8662,2020-12-01T20:11:26.170000+00:00,"Yeah, but why would you want to map all the things people do in the browser?"
8663,2020-12-01T20:11:12.963000+00:00,So like a few persona's share them same scenario you mean?
8664,2020-12-01T20:11:02.263000+00:00,"like there's a lot more things people do in a browser, but that's fine"
8665,2020-12-01T20:07:14.898000+00:00,"So maybe they still cover what's important, even if they're pretty specific"
8666,2020-12-01T20:06:20.355000+00:00,"It's like - the specific scenarios only one of these people have, they would still be using basic functionality of the app for"
8667,2020-12-01T20:05:29.285000+00:00,"If mainly the scenarios are the most important thing I think you should worry about making those! The steps before don't matter, if where they fit is irrelevant"
8668,2020-12-01T20:04:39.578000+00:00,"ooooh, that's probably the case ^^"
8669,2020-12-01T20:03:27.733000+00:00,Especially for displaying latent needs / values
8670,2020-12-01T20:02:56.071000+00:00,"Then that doesn't matter, I guess the persona is really there to remind you of the research. How I see it at least."
8671,2020-12-01T20:02:10.691000+00:00,"I see some examples for specific use cases, that makes sense"
8672,2020-12-01T20:01:49.491000+00:00,Oh nvm about the journey.
8673,2020-12-01T20:01:12.624000+00:00,"a clear difference, yeah. but then if a certain *scenario* is inherently something that would fit for all of these personas?"
8674,2020-12-01T19:59:26.516000+00:00,I think it's only important to create a second one if there's a clear difference in user/person
8675,2020-12-01T19:59:06.369000+00:00,"Yeah, one persona can have a lot of scenarios"
8676,2020-12-01T19:58:58.016000+00:00,How so? A web browser is still a journey I suppose.
8677,2020-12-01T19:57:36.682000+00:00,"> multiple scenarios for one persona though
but the inverse?"
8678,2020-12-01T19:56:42.022000+00:00,"Seems weird to me, in the case of a web browser huh"
8679,2020-12-01T19:52:47.073000+00:00,Sounds a user journey of that might fit better though!
8680,2020-12-01T19:52:35.258000+00:00,New personas are especially interesting when latent needs are different I suppose
8681,2020-12-01T19:51:54.008000+00:00,I think you could easily have multiple scenarios for one persona though
8682,2020-12-01T18:50:43.978000+00:00,"- honestly, a bunch of this feels a little stranger than it would if this was happening in a team, for a client, etc. communicating things to others seems like a huge portion of why these methods exist, besides making things clear for yourself"
8683,2020-12-01T18:46:28.260000+00:00,"this might be a pretty general element basically everyone could be using, so it feels weird to almost randomly write the name of one persona in the corner and think through it all from their view"
8684,2020-12-01T18:45:48.288000+00:00,"For example, one of the bigger ideas is that instead of separate windows or tab groups, you could be arranging things into projects you can resume a week later or something, and ""complete"""
8685,2020-12-01T18:44:10.938000+00:00,"But then, some scenarios might equally apply to all these people, because they are just so general...."
8686,2020-12-01T18:42:36.149000+00:00,...and so on.
8687,2020-12-01T18:42:33.027000+00:00,"someone more interested in sharing what they find with other people on social media, look up who sent them something etc"
8688,2020-12-01T18:41:53.881000+00:00,or an artist looking for inspiration
8689,2020-12-01T18:41:44.302000+00:00,"(...in the case of a browser for collecting/connecting interesting things you find online...) there might be a student looking to annotate and reference a lot of articles, papers etc"
8690,2020-12-01T18:39:42.081000+00:00,So it's not just the demographics changing
8691,2020-12-01T18:39:27.170000+00:00,"So - each persona should have different goals for what to do with the product, right?"
8692,2020-12-01T18:37:09.977000+00:00,"Okay, back"
8693,2020-12-01T18:20:39.883000+00:00,How do you mean?
8694,2020-12-01T17:20:12.860000+00:00,"But use cases could be for very general things that all of these people would be doing, and still useful?"
8695,2020-12-01T17:19:37.188000+00:00,"It makes sense for those to be, well, different. Not overlap much"
8696,2020-12-01T17:19:14.078000+00:00,"If you have difficulty connecting scenarios and use cases with specific personas, is that a problem with those personas?"
8697,2020-12-01T15:18:05.534000+00:00,Hi Nicolette!
8698,2020-11-30T02:00:09.210000+00:00,Yes
8699,2020-11-30T01:59:24.943000+00:00,Hello
8700,2020-11-30T01:55:36.270000+00:00,Haha <@!700697880352129125> are you a tea over coffee person?
8701,2020-11-29T23:34:29.897000+00:00,<@!267268356002938880> hii!
8702,2020-11-29T23:18:46.270000+00:00,Just wanted to jump in and say hi fellow researchers!
8703,2020-11-27T13:32:30.003000+00:00,Read the channel description
8704,2020-11-27T13:32:04.318000+00:00,Hey <@!726747122237702194> please share your survey here <#708809627260944436>
8705,2020-11-27T08:18:50.919000+00:00,Never hired someone<:lmoa:697917150131781705>
8706,2020-11-27T08:18:22.505000+00:00,But I wouldn't be sure
8707,2020-11-27T08:18:09.594000+00:00,It kind of depends how well you show your process I think
8708,2020-11-26T16:34:14.023000+00:00,"btw I see you're at UNICEF right now, whereabouts?  I lived in Geneva for a long time so was wondering if you're in one of the offices there."
8709,2020-11-26T16:32:08.241000+00:00,"<@!185798036515979266> I have done a few UXR specific interviews recently, but haven't landed an offer yet - so I'll focus on the questions I've been asked as opposed to advice. 

A lot of questions about how you would design a particular study, often very open-ended. E.g. We are having a problem with feature X. Outline a research problem to address this.  What methodologies would you use, what's your process, what's the timeline etc.

Lots of questions about how you share your research and work within a team - how do you make sure that your research is having impact and isn't just a silo. 

Almost always asked to show some research heavy projects, ideally some examples of both generative and evaluative research. And they all want to see something that's relevant to them. E.g. research that related to business decisions for a startup, or research that included vulnerable groups for a more socially minded org. Stuff like that"
8710,2020-11-26T07:50:27.919000+00:00,But then it doesn't rhyme
8711,2020-11-26T07:49:42.021000+00:00,Solicitation Conversation
8712,2020-11-26T07:49:30.749000+00:00,In dutch a job interview would be directly translated as
8713,2020-11-26T07:48:58.967000+00:00,"Is in the English language the act of 'Interviewing' always tied to a job, or also to a user interview?"
8714,2020-11-26T07:48:20.108000+00:00,It's confusing both a job interview and user interview are the same words
8715,2020-11-26T07:42:13.588000+00:00,"Nope not you, hahahaüòÅ"
8716,2020-11-26T07:37:49.007000+00:00,"idk if i was typing but if i was, it was an accident lol"
8717,2020-11-26T07:35:47.738000+00:00,I see you typingüëÄ
8718,2020-11-26T07:35:09.538000+00:00,At least three you are very proud of
8719,2020-11-26T07:31:40.774000+00:00,I imagine a case study is quite important...
8720,2020-11-26T07:31:05.929000+00:00,Ahh
8721,2020-11-26T07:24:15.641000+00:00,"job interview for UXR, i'm pretty sure"
8722,2020-11-26T07:19:04.435000+00:00,"What kind of interviewing you mean, like user interviewing or a job interview for UX research?"
8723,2020-11-26T02:19:30.446000+00:00,They may also ask you what you might have done differently
8724,2020-11-26T02:18:11.926000+00:00,"You should also think of one or two other projects that you didn‚Äôt present, as they may ask you questions about different methods you might have done or other outcomes"
8725,2020-11-26T02:17:03.898000+00:00,"<@!185798036515979266> I don‚Äôt have much experience, but you will most likely need to prepare a slide deck to present one of your projects"
8726,2020-11-26T02:15:58.517000+00:00,"But with regards with my project, I understand, I guess maybe I need more like a service mapping not really a customer journey"
8727,2020-11-26T02:14:39.914000+00:00,<@!181895166460690432> I was just thinking it would be cool if you could VR to follow a customer journey. Some things are hard to represent on paper üòä
8728,2020-11-25T21:48:41.774000+00:00,Sounds like a short time for that amount of worküòµ
8729,2020-11-25T18:49:24.530000+00:00,"Does anyone have experience submitting daily or weekly quotes for contract work? I'm submitting for a research position that includes ~40 interviews, personas, and synthesis expected to take ~10 weeks"
8730,2020-11-25T18:32:56.096000+00:00,journey maps are usually tailored to a specific experience...you mean you wish there where more examples?
8731,2020-11-25T18:31:25.385000+00:00,I wish someone would make VR customer journey mapping!
8732,2020-11-25T15:43:40.488000+00:00,My project involves three different personas and many touch points and interactions with the same application so I was wondering if it‚Äôs possible to show it all together but could be too complex
8733,2020-11-25T15:41:46.330000+00:00,"<@!209640428151111680> I‚Äôll try that out, thank you so much for your advice!"
8734,2020-11-25T09:41:30.584000+00:00,Apparently they're 20k words
8735,2020-11-25T09:41:24.273000+00:00,I was about to put all intervie transcriptions in my paper
8736,2020-11-25T09:41:06.103000+00:00,Oh damn...
8737,2020-11-25T07:36:36.201000+00:00,^ yea that makes sense
8738,2020-11-25T07:26:17.446000+00:00,That you can connect to user journeys at specific points
8739,2020-11-25T07:26:05.247000+00:00,The complex interactions are better in story boards
8740,2020-11-25T07:25:26.722000+00:00,If there's multiple people you make multiple journeys
8741,2020-11-25T07:25:16.881000+00:00,"Not sure if others agree, but you make one user journey per persona"
8742,2020-11-25T00:10:52.960000+00:00,"Hi, I was wondering if anyone had any tips or examples for a customer journey map that involves multiple people or complex interactions?"

8765,2020-11-24T10:29:34.557000+00:00,I think that's called a measurement plan
8766,2020-11-24T10:28:55.057000+00:00,How many seconds on average it takes to get from A tot B for example
8767,2020-11-24T10:28:37.745000+00:00,Then maybe make a few themes you want to analyse first

9025,2020-11-09T17:12:21.277000+00:00,"It's best to have a plan before testing. Now it's a general test, but what are the specific things you want to know?"
9026,2020-11-09T17:11:13.756000+00:00,Have you defined what to test?
9027,2020-11-09T16:44:56.529000+00:00,<@522736606520672266> thanks!
9028,2020-11-09T16:44:43.013000+00:00,"No, Just I want to help me to conduct my first usability test and get me your feedback as ux designer to make my test better. <@!598373085120299018>"
9029,2020-11-09T16:35:12.706000+00:00,"<@522736606520672266> - just to clarify, are you looking for users to test your prototypes that you linked?"
9030,2020-11-09T16:24:50.465000+00:00,This is what I created: https://app.useberry.com/preview/K856wVJY/
9031,2020-11-09T14:31:14.882000+00:00,"Hey everyone, I'm a junior UX designer and I want to run a remote unmoderated usability test for a multi-step funnel that I designed for a roofing company to ask their customers a couple of questions to conduct roof inspection.

Here is a link to check out my prototype: 

[https://www.figma.com/proto/0jG9RZpPU5DUY1E28pakck/Design-System-MVP?node-id=625%3A5&viewport=1734%2C-2844%2C0.25&scaling=scale-down](https://www.figma.com/proto/0jG9RZpPU5DUY1E28pakck/Design-System-MVP?node-id=625%3A5&viewport=1734%2C-2844%2C0.25&scaling=scale-down)

My question is what & how things I need to measure them in this stage to find out usability issues before code UI. I found [maze.design](http://maze.design/) and [useberry.com](http://useberry.com/) to conduct remote usability test."
9032,2020-11-08T16:07:25.360000+00:00,That's what some people use
9033,2020-11-08T16:06:21.045000+00:00,<@!90372586965336064> https://lookback.io/
9034,2020-11-08T14:32:11.145000+00:00,Will need users in the future but right now need to test the prototypes in my team
9035,2020-11-08T14:31:43.140000+00:00,Those are usually for finding users for testing right? I kind of want a platform that takes my figma designs and enables me to create prototypes with logic to distribute to some selected people.
9036,2020-11-08T14:23:30.592000+00:00,"Mostly used usertesting, but my company just paid for unlimited users so no idea on cost. If you put in the effort, I'm sure you can set something up with mechanicalturk, which is very cheap."
9037,2020-11-08T12:38:50.680000+00:00,is it a-maze-ing?
9038,2020-11-08T07:46:24.135000+00:00,"Hey guys, what do you use for user testing? I am looking at this service called maze rn and was wondering if there are any better/cheaper alternatives out there."
9039,2020-11-05T12:07:39.838000+00:00,<@!567405891318579200>  Sorry about it. üòÖ

9041,2020-11-04T15:54:10.877000+00:00,I'll put up a post then
9042,2020-11-04T15:53:49.570000+00:00,lol. Well we're going to be hiring for research again in 2021.
9043,2020-11-04T15:52:41.972000+00:00,sorry guys
9044,2020-11-04T15:52:12.893000+00:00,also I just realized I never followed up with a recruiter from thriver from a month ago. Oops üíÄ
9045,2020-11-04T15:50:55.059000+00:00,Haha story of my life
9046,2020-11-04T15:49:46.055000+00:00,"It even just makes me think of how executives often treat the whole UX process - what do you mean, can't we just have the devs ""make some changes?!"""
9047,2020-11-04T15:49:44.105000+00:00,"Yeah. There is a false equivalency with Jobs' success because ""he's a genius"" and it won't work for most companies."
9048,2020-11-04T15:49:16.203000+00:00,Yeah that's a great point about the C-suit being scared of delays.
9049,2020-11-04T15:48:42.123000+00:00,And in a lot of cases I see that value in that
9050,2020-11-04T15:48:32.779000+00:00,This is a bit cheesy but I'm reading the famous Jobs biography. There are so many great moments when he sees a product and just runs wild with it after 1 meeting ; the people proposing the product expected months of market research etc and are shocked
9051,2020-11-04T15:48:31.649000+00:00,"It's interesting from the perspective of selling research to C-suite folks on the value of research. 9/10 their worry is ""well that is just going to slow down product development if we centralize research."" They don't even want research to be a gate."
9052,2020-11-04T15:47:19.573000+00:00,Haha thanks <@!547965428660437003> ! Appreciate the comment. Yes this is what I've experienced as well. The best researchers or research teams I've worked with do very little evaluative research. Usually that falls on product or design actually.
9053,2020-11-04T15:44:36.533000+00:00,Also I just made the connection that it's your post lol
9054,2020-11-04T15:44:14.812000+00:00,"Definitely agree. Especially for organizations that are new to UXR I think there is a tendency to treat research as ""should we do A or B"" rather than focusing on the why. Some of the best research I've done was completely generative and didn't have much to do with existing plans"
9055,2020-11-04T15:37:31.344000+00:00,"A research post for y'all, would love to hear what people think. Especially from those actively practicing research today. https://www.linkedin.com/posts/brianisme_research-product-userresearch-activity-6729774752170356736-IVHX"

9066,2020-10-31T22:19:05.763000+00:00,Yeah kind of like the nudge approach
9067,2020-10-31T22:18:37.418000+00:00,Too much man haha
9068,2020-10-31T22:18:35.701000+00:00,"Not really inluencing, more like, lowering the barrier maybe"
9069,2020-10-31T22:18:34.175000+00:00,Woah im trying to follow all the lines in the graph
9070,2020-10-31T22:18:25.174000+00:00,"Yeah, it's another approach"
9071,2020-10-31T22:17:57+00:00,It's more a case of using a model depending on what kind of research question / design you have
9072,2020-10-31T22:17:10.143000+00:00,But it can definitely be used that way
9073,2020-10-31T22:16:55.178000+00:00,Anyways I agree Fogg isn't super applied
9074,2020-10-31T22:16:36.545000+00:00,Oh yeah all the social models as well
9075,2020-10-31T22:16:15.327000+00:00,For nudging distance etc
9076,2020-10-31T22:16:13.623000+00:00,
9077,2020-10-31T22:16:07.919000+00:00,Pretty crazy models
9078,2020-10-31T22:15:20.833000+00:00,
9079,2020-10-31T22:15:06.224000+00:00,"Ah yes, I'm currently studying one for my project of cogsci"
9080,2020-10-31T22:14:48.589000+00:00,I mostly focused on dual systems model
9081,2020-10-31T22:14:41.185000+00:00,"But the foggs model wasn't very useful imo, to be applied widely at least. The general idea is there, but it's more of a way of thinking than a functional model"
9082,2020-10-31T22:13:57.228000+00:00,like beyond hci
9083,2020-10-31T22:13:53.764000+00:00,there are so many models its insane. Especially when you get more into the cogsci papers
9084,2020-10-31T22:13:25.166000+00:00,https://toolkit.bridgeable.com/
9085,2020-10-31T22:13:03.145000+00:00,There's also this one
9086,2020-10-31T22:12:59.759000+00:00,"I'm currently doing some research to BE principles for my project, so I've taken some time to look up different models."
9087,2020-10-31T22:12:37.721000+00:00,It looks very HCI/UX specific which is useful
9088,2020-10-31T22:12:18.698000+00:00,I haven't heard of the EAST one but I will give it a look
9089,2020-10-31T22:10:21.434000+00:00,Anyways I don't even know if it's a very scientifically valid model. But that's how you can use it
9090,2020-10-31T22:09:58.994000+00:00,you get behavioral change
9091,2020-10-31T22:09:50.658000+00:00,"and by giving people an occasional "" escape hatch"" way to esecape the feed by suggesting other activities"
9092,2020-10-31T22:09:27.384000+00:00,a few of the designed examples focused on the trigger aspect
9093,2020-10-31T22:09:24.508000+00:00,https://www.behaviouralinsights.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/BIT-Publication-EAST_FA_WEB.pdf
9094,2020-10-31T22:09:23.489000+00:00,But that's one of the issues if you compare to lets say
9095,2020-10-31T22:09:19.947000+00:00,"For example my msc thesis was about preventing ""mindless browsing"". Often people fall into this trap of scrolling"
9096,2020-10-31T22:09:12.159000+00:00,I get the thought behind it indeed
9097,2020-10-31T22:08:46.893000+00:00,honestly though this example is a bit stretched.
9098,2020-10-31T22:08:27.408000+00:00,boom boom foggs model told you to modify their ability ( to spend)
9099,2020-10-31T22:08:12.844000+00:00,In that case you might not be able to influence your group much. But imagine you're a company that can launch credit cards for kids
9100,2020-10-31T22:07:32.484000+00:00,"But then it isn't really behavioural influence right? More like, analysing someone behavioural ability"
9101,2020-10-31T22:07:05.660000+00:00,kind of a contrived example but that's the general direction
9102,2020-10-31T22:06:00.228000+00:00,"otherwise put you gotta fix their ability, or all things equal a group with more ability is more likely to purchase coins"
9103,2020-10-31T22:04:45.085000+00:00,or figure out how to get the parents to want to pull out the CC
9104,2020-10-31T22:04:25.547000+00:00,therefore you should focus on alternative monetization
9105,2020-10-31T22:04:02.109000+00:00,because kids dont have credit cards
9106,2020-10-31T22:03:56.228000+00:00,the model very clearly shows this wont work because they have (less) ability to do this
9107,2020-10-31T22:03:44.538000+00:00,Ok so for example lets say all your users are children and you want them to buy coins in your app
9108,2020-10-31T22:03:15.749000+00:00,How would you apply it?
9109,2020-10-31T22:02:40.172000+00:00,motivation is only 1 part of it. Anyways I actually have no clue how effective it is at describing or predicting behaviour
9110,2020-10-31T22:01:39.292000+00:00,"<@!209640428151111680> I think Fogg actually wrote quite a bit about each piece of his model and breaks them down into smaller pieces. WHen you look at the smaller pieces (e.g. ability to do an action - having the time, resources, mental capacity etc), it can definitely be used a way to make design decisions"
9111,2020-10-31T18:07:30.231000+00:00,"<@!694200749625966694> does your question have to do with UX research by any chance? i‚Äôd move your post to <#759158728355217439> or <#709876389356240938> if it doesn‚Äôt, thank you!"
9112,2020-10-31T15:30:36.069000+00:00,So I think it's more something to explain behaviour instead of influencing behaviour
9113,2020-10-31T15:28:26.927000+00:00,It doesn't tell you how to motivate
9114,2020-10-31T15:28:20.950000+00:00,I suppose it tells you people need motivation to do something
9115,2020-10-31T15:27:56.560000+00:00,"Mhh, I don't think fogg is very practical"
9116,2020-10-31T15:22:21.372000+00:00,foggs model for persuading people to adopt a behaviour i guess?
9117,2020-10-31T14:31:36.452000+00:00,<@!690261744928424062> for what are you using Foggs model?

9123,2020-10-31T11:15:50.631000+00:00,"But if your design goal is to make people less scared of a heart surgery at a specific hospital, the fears you will see are pretty similar"

9135,2020-10-31T03:41:51.357000+00:00,empathy maps have always felt like process for the sake of pretending you're doing things of substance
9136,2020-10-30T23:14:46.666000+00:00,huh never seen that face map before!
9137,2020-10-30T21:58:57.003000+00:00,I prefer value proposition mapping

9144,2020-10-30T21:55:08.082000+00:00,I still find empathy mapping a bit vague

9184,2020-10-27T04:19:33.716000+00:00,when you do the research
9185,2020-10-25T21:26:19.712000+00:00,If you do 5 user interviews but those 5 people are different type of users the number is flawed
9186,2020-10-25T21:25:49.786000+00:00,Finding that users can still take 20 interviews though
9187,2020-10-25T21:25:38.995000+00:00,5 is a nice standard if you found your user

<@!359761158888095744> The number of participants is actually based on the depth of your study

if it is quantitative then go for 20-30

if it is qualitative then only for for 5-6

an empathy interview would fall under a qualitative study, especially if you consider the demographics of your target audience. So 5-6 is perfect."

9220,2020-10-22T21:11:22.534000+00:00,Lot of science questions aren't wicked problems
9221,2020-10-22T21:10:55.105000+00:00,I imagine a lot of researchers doing natural sciences wouldn't do good with design research
9222,2020-10-22T16:51:09.651000+00:00,"haha yeah, I forgot how this started"
9223,2020-10-22T16:49:46.603000+00:00,anyways I think this all started when you said you wouldn't consider it necessary for a product designer or UX designer and I agree
9224,2020-10-22T16:48:23.800000+00:00,that's true and there's a lot of room for more seasoned UX people to share good research practices
9225,2020-10-22T16:47:33.093000+00:00,this is how you conduct a SUS or SEQ or whatever
9226,2020-10-22T16:47:26.032000+00:00,also full disclosure I'm definitely talking from a position of justifying my decision to do an MSc lol. And some of my terrible research practices beforehand
9227,2020-10-22T16:47:22.963000+00:00,this is how you respond to questions from the participant to elicit the feedback you're looking for
9228,2020-10-22T16:47:05.840000+00:00,"Here are some boilerplate scripts, this is how you ask questions without leading"
9229,2020-10-22T16:46:33.058000+00:00,maybe not many good resources for basic research
9230,2020-10-22T16:46:15.858000+00:00,"but I'd also argue that there is a lot of decent training for ""how to be a UX designer"" in a practical sense of ""this is how you make wireframes"" or ""this is how you ___"" but"
9231,2020-10-22T16:45:32.270000+00:00,"Yeah, there are plenty of /user tests/ where the moderator/facilitator leads the participant, or doesn't know processes or methods of capturing feedback beyond just verbatim responses to be digested later"
9232,2020-10-22T16:45:18.503000+00:00,"Then write the feedback on post-its for the pretty picture, some pseudo thematic analysis and boom bam it's UX"
9233,2020-10-22T16:43:37.286000+00:00,"But it does irk me when I see a ""user test"" (??) being done and the researcher just asks ""so what do you think"". or ""give me your opinions on this"". And honestly it does seem to be one of the most common forms of UXR going on right now"
9234,2020-10-22T16:41:32.267000+00:00,yeah definitely agree with that
9235,2020-10-22T16:41:23.255000+00:00,I guess a large part of it as well is just the ambiguity of UX. It's such a fluid role that means so many different things at different places
9236,2020-10-22T16:41:02.553000+00:00,Yeah I like the idea of UX being a kind of inbetween
9237,2020-10-22T16:38:38.192000+00:00,and this is like basic basic stuff
9238,2020-10-22T16:38:37.145000+00:00,"abstracting from the hyper granular science to something that is usable, or digestible by the average designer is maybe ""the point"" of UX"
9239,2020-10-22T16:38:33.636000+00:00,"nah ofc not. But for example, I don't think your typical UX designer could answer ""What is a blind study"""
9240,2020-10-22T16:38:21.731000+00:00,"My flatmate that did an ergonomics design degree had some useful info like that for all sorts of things, there's an awful lot of crazy specific research out there if you want to go find it"
9241,2020-10-22T16:38:04.582000+00:00,to know that something is too small
9242,2020-10-22T16:38:00.664000+00:00,however I dont think a designer needs to know how to calculate minutes of arc
9243,2020-10-22T16:37:50.182000+00:00,and so I agree about being able to come to solid conclusions supported by facts and evidence and scientific method
9244,2020-10-22T16:37:48.167000+00:00,yeah
9245,2020-10-22T16:37:43.513000+00:00,as a fraction of your field of view right?
9246,2020-10-22T16:37:09.476000+00:00,"which is basically a scaling size, based on distance from you"
9247,2020-10-22T16:36:33.125000+00:00,"I'm trying to find them right now, but they basically made a determination of what they deemed to be ""legible' or maybe readable? and it's basically how tall words need to be in minutes of arc (arcminutes)"
9248,2020-10-22T16:35:39.960000+00:00,sorry so you were saying about the USAF papers

9264,2020-10-22T13:22:20.942000+00:00,"<@!209640428151111680>  I'm struggling to find the name of it, but one of the major american ISPs developed this insane video calling tech (early 2000s?). They basically installed custom rooms on either end, with with life size screens and cameras. They ran custom fibre between the rooms so latency was as low as possible, no interference or other people using the cable. Apparently it really replicated the experience of an in-person meeting. However, it's ungodly expensive so I don't think it really took off as a standard tool.

9269,2020-10-22T07:14:20.549000+00:00,"hhahaha, the bad case of having to go through a one-sided meeting"
9270,2020-10-22T07:13:43.854000+00:00,"there is some camera facing skills u need, same like how announcers and those on tv present"
9271,2020-10-22T07:00:35.627000+00:00,They talk the whole meetingü§£
9272,2020-10-22T07:00:06.019000+00:00,Now if someone talks too much
9273,2020-10-22T06:59:50.970000+00:00,"Plus you don't both stop, usually one persists"
9274,2020-10-22T06:59:29.453000+00:00,"I guess speaking at the same time happens irl, but nowhere near the amount it happens remotely"
9275,2020-10-22T06:57:18.998000+00:00,"> Yea... I find that the turn to talk can still be visible in video chats. but usually it's just a lot of problems with the sound. And with problems with sound, we then look for other visual cues such as mouth shapes and body language. in video calls, sometimes it's those blurry images that becomes a problem. i never had a call with clear enough visuals, so i dont know if these problems will still persist if we have low-latency communication
<@154886580094369792>

9337,2020-10-20T06:20:48.898000+00:00,"Hey researchers,
Quick question about user journeys :
Do you usually create a user journey during generative research (you already have a product that needs better UX, and you are trying to determine pain points etc...), or do you do it during evaluative research (you have a prototype and you are trying to see the pain points according to your userflows) ?

Also, when you are creating one, most of the time, are you doing it internally (judging what are / aren't pain points and happy points), or do you conduct user interviews specifically for those user journeys ?"
9338,2020-10-19T22:20:42.148000+00:00,"How much time should this take? (Because I think it‚Äôs taking too long, but I‚Äôve also got dat imposter syndrome)"
9339,2020-10-19T22:20:05.456000+00:00,Any activities I‚Äôm totally overlooking?
9340,2020-10-19T22:19:51.052000+00:00,"So, some questions if anybody can lend the brainpower; how many surveys, or how much time elapsed before I crunch the data?"
9341,2020-10-19T22:19:07.508000+00:00,"Could use some advice on an internal thing. Cultural research on a 500+ person org to determine some culture, goals, comms and maybe visual design stuff. 100% volunteer. External voice of customer already done.

Reaching 500 internal means a survey,  but the homegrown tool is total shit so a lot of excel mapping. Using some Liberating Structures activities to follow up the quant of the survey with some qual with people who said it‚Äôd be cool to circle back.

Mapping internal and external research to a list of design principles, culminating in 1 to 3 paths that‚Äôll be pitched to a chief whatever.

9404,2020-10-14T21:29:21.470000+00:00,"But especially since you want to iterate it, move it around, change context, prototype it with real users, it needs to be as flexible as possible"
9405,2020-10-14T21:28:04.972000+00:00,Then later of course you could use something like Figma to design it in more depth
9406,2020-10-14T21:26:35.470000+00:00,
9407,2020-10-14T21:26:32.748000+00:00,Like this for example
9408,2020-10-14T21:26:27.751000+00:00,You could even let users map their own journey
9409,2020-10-14T21:25:38.370000+00:00,"WHich is what you need for a user journey, since the journey changes all the time when you iterate it"

9412,2020-10-14T21:24:49.049000+00:00,I don't think that's an effective way
9413,2020-10-14T14:37:45.576000+00:00,<@!207034390402826241> You could even do in figma or sketch using any existing templates. Also easy to export and add to your portfolio. Doc definitely is not the ideal way for user journey mapping because we should be able to look at the user journey from a birds eye view and focus on to whichever part of the journey as needed.
9414,2020-10-14T05:13:39.413000+00:00,harder to present in a portfolio at the end of the project for one thing üòõ

9416,2020-10-14T05:12:01.010000+00:00,right now I'm just putting descriptions of each step + pain points and opportunities in a Google Docs table

9418,2020-10-14T05:11:52.477000+00:00,Figma all the way
9419,2020-10-14T05:11:44.376000+00:00,mm yeah I was thinking of just using Illustrator or something
9420,2020-10-14T05:11:30.578000+00:00,We use Miro too. But I also work in start ups that don't want to pay for access and we can't handle only have 3 free boards so we custom build them in figma lmao

I am using uxchallenge.co per their recommendations. I‚Äôm at the tail end of the 4th step right now of the challenge (List and Rate Outcomes) where it is suggested to do competitive research and user interviews to find out more about their pain points and needs. (In my case, the project is a language learning app for people to learn basic survival language.) My question is, what kind of competitive research do I need to do and how? Also, how in‚Äìdepth does this need to be? Although I actually would love to go very in-depth, I do not have the time nor resources to go extremely in-depth, since many of whom I would need to interview/survey may not even have a reliable internet connection. I was encouraged by Grace‚Äôs FB post to start doing a project even when just starting out learning in a basic class, but now I‚Äôm finding I‚Äôm stuck! üòÜ Anyway, I‚Äôd really appreciate any suggestions or ideas for this newbie here. üòÉ Thanks y‚Äôall!"

9450,2020-10-07T17:26:16.008000+00:00,I helped ship this (among other things) at Jaguar Land Rover: https://www.sbdautomotive.com/en/defender-ux
9451,2020-10-07T17:22:41.840000+00:00,its a portmanteau of information and entertainment but generally refers to any of the screens and content in a vehicle
9452,2020-10-07T17:21:36.120000+00:00,oh
9453,2020-10-07T17:15:22.267000+00:00,"so, <@!218928410263683073>  what exactly do you mean by infotainment ? i'm interested"
9454,2020-10-07T17:14:52.870000+00:00,gotcha - that's what i thought too. So i started an in-context usability test so that we can measure task completion (and other usability metrics) by swapping the icons.
9455,2020-10-07T16:57:31.754000+00:00,with icons swapped
9456,2020-10-07T16:57:24.705000+00:00,"ultimately though, an icon is a form of communication. You could just measure task completion and some usability metrics for variants of the same UI"
9457,2020-10-07T16:54:33.749000+00:00,imo a labeling exercise with your users is a good first step
9458,2020-10-07T16:51:43.735000+00:00,"I've tested icons for infotainment, and then tested icons for localization"
9459,2020-10-07T15:03:14.805000+00:00,"more background - we have a couple of options in terms of iconography to save an item to a list, we have some people saying that the ""+"" sign makes sense, we have some saying a "" ‚ù§Ô∏è "" makes sense because our competitors do it, and there are other alternatives in the wild like ""bookmark icon"" that could be another contender. I know this is a great situation to test something, but, not my strong suit since i've never tested for icons."
9460,2020-10-07T15:01:08.964000+00:00,"has anyone in here tested icons? 
i found this article, but wanted to better understand how to approach something like this.

9461,2020-10-07T01:45:27.628000+00:00,"Thanks for your thoughts on my question <@!218928410263683073> üôÇ just to clear: when i said ""creating credible evidence on how to move forward"" i did mean to reduce risk in the ways you describes. How you presented it uses clearer terminology so I'll describe it that way from now on, thank you! ha ha"
9462,2020-10-06T17:16:55.896000+00:00,either approach is fine
9463,2020-10-06T17:16:47.403000+00:00,or you can start with empty-ish personas and slowly fill them in as you go
9464,2020-10-06T17:16:36.431000+00:00,to the key insights
9465,2020-10-06T17:16:30.948000+00:00,"you can start with a lot of stuff in them, and slowly whittle it down"
9466,2020-10-06T17:16:22.298000+00:00,"Thats ok too, good personas are emergent"
9467,2020-10-06T17:00:54.224000+00:00,Just a problem context
9468,2020-10-06T17:00:46.515000+00:00,I guess there's no product yet too
9469,2020-10-06T16:58:34.459000+00:00,Now it's indeed just a collection of data
9470,2020-10-06T16:58:27.833000+00:00,"Alright makes sense, I can definitely use that"
9471,2020-10-06T16:57:43.671000+00:00,I'm trying to combine it with a journey and empathy map
9472,2020-10-06T16:57:23.824000+00:00,so only you can be the filter for the relevancy of information
9473,2020-10-06T16:57:10.082000+00:00,"yeah, and I dont have a way of vetting that as an outsider. Personas have no value to me, because i'm not working on your product"
9474,2020-10-06T16:56:44.893000+00:00,But I guess the point your making is; all information stated should be related to a design choice? <@!218928410263683073>
9475,2020-10-06T16:56:44.317000+00:00,<:blobwat:711813052244164680>
9476,2020-10-06T16:56:02.019000+00:00,
9477,2020-10-06T16:54:50.940000+00:00,There's a fun example in the book
9478,2020-10-06T16:54:34.547000+00:00,I suppose I agree with demographics indeed
9479,2020-10-06T16:51:14.511000+00:00,I guess the main design direction the current persona would give is the fact that's she's a new colleague and has difficulty meeting others in the office
9480,2020-10-06T16:49:41.656000+00:00,"The main info I get from the post is that persona's should not use demographics, because people will make assumptions based on that info"
9481,2020-10-06T16:47:17.155000+00:00,So basically it should focus on a specific context?
9482,2020-10-06T16:38:39.804000+00:00,"not in the creation of personas, but in the impact the statements about the persona make on the end-product"
9483,2020-10-06T16:37:56.952000+00:00,a point it makes is that every statement about the persona should reflect / indicate a change in design direction
9484,2020-10-06T16:37:25.019000+00:00,this is kind of verbose but
9485,2020-10-06T16:36:47.600000+00:00,https://medium.com/inclusive-software/describing-personas-af992e3fc527

9487,2020-10-06T16:28:20.497000+00:00,"The data is based on 10 interviews, which are each around 30Min -/+ each"
9488,2020-10-06T16:27:18.611000+00:00,"Looking at the information, it's sort of like looking at it in a vacuum. I don't have a good reference point for how thin or robust they need to be in order to fit your needs or goals"
9489,2020-10-06T16:26:48.898000+00:00,"I guess right now if we assume that your persona data is good enough, how are you going to be using your persona(s)?"
9490,2020-10-06T16:25:47.700000+00:00,"Yeah, I thought it would be nice to include the part of the value proposition too"
9491,2020-10-06T16:19:14.625000+00:00,I like the inclusion of the JTBD framework
9492,2020-10-06T16:15:05.210000+00:00,"For example, (most) people seem to be more productive at home as a positive side"
9493,2020-10-06T16:14:27.803000+00:00,I also have a lot of other data that I'm not sure I should put their
9494,2020-10-06T16:13:32.790000+00:00,"So, I'd mostly love feedback on the content instead"
9495,2020-10-06T16:13:24.927000+00:00,The design is crap (going to try and change that later)
9496,2020-10-06T16:13:22.238000+00:00,
9497,2020-10-06T16:13:11.250000+00:00,"Anway, this is the persona"
9498,2020-10-06T16:07:16.639000+00:00,I think the difference between normal research and design is that with design you're often trying to research a future state that does not exist yet. While science research is often something that's already present
9499,2020-10-06T15:52:37.209000+00:00,"> So, to my mind the goal of doing research is to help along the design process. You're creating credible evidence on how to move forward in the design process.

This is somewhat true but maybe not the entire picture. You aren't ""creating credible evidence on how to move forward"". Evidence implies that there is a burden of proof. The goal of user research is to reduce risk. Thats the entire value prop of UX Design. Get it right more often, more quickly and more cheaply, so you dont waste time and resources getting it wrong."
9500,2020-10-06T15:47:32.915000+00:00,"> is an insight/context/requirement/recommendation different names for the same ""thing"" you're producing through your research? Maybe packaged slightly differently?

No. Different things.

Insights are snippets of deep understanding usually gained during synthesis or observation. These can be deliverables.

Context is a bunch of different aspects of understanding the frame surrounding a situation. It's not a deliverable.

Requirements (user requirements) are success criteria based on user needs.

Recommendations are the step after insights, they are actionable advice provided to the team that makes things from the POV of an expert."

9513,2020-10-06T12:29:57.178000+00:00,"well, not *totally* pointless if you're going to play around with those things and try to come up with ways to present an insight or recommendation etc. but yeah"
9514,2020-10-06T12:28:54.937000+00:00,"yes i see what you mean - i see it similarly, which is kinda what i was getting at with my question: is there a ""common ancestor"" those things come from before they diverge,  in the same way slack and discord come from instant messaging and other things - you're also right, utterly pointless in practice it's just fun to think about üòÇ"
9515,2020-10-06T12:20:27.774000+00:00,But at the same time they're not
9516,2020-10-06T12:20:17.158000+00:00,"A bit like how Discord is kinda like Slack, because they're very alike"
9517,2020-10-06T12:19:12.509000+00:00,The most interesting points of information happens in graphs where they aren't connected
9518,2020-10-06T12:18:37.473000+00:00,Imagine having a graph where everything is connected to everything else
9519,2020-10-06T12:18:24.545000+00:00,"We could say for example, evolution of species is kind of the same like evolution in star formations and we can be very philosophical about that. But in research it's completely unusable imo"
9520,2020-10-06T12:16:58.190000+00:00,"Yeah, it think it can be a fallacy to connect related terms"
9521,2020-10-06T12:16:06.279000+00:00,Yes that's true <@!209640428151111680> - i agree üòÑ there's enough overlap between those things to make me think they're related but they're still different considerations on how to move forward. I made my question a bit vague as i was interested to see if there were different perspectives i hadn't considered haha
9522,2020-10-06T12:09:20.234000+00:00,"I'd say insights can be context related, but contexts aren't insights by themselves, same with requirements or recommendations"
9523,2020-10-06T12:07:08.873000+00:00,<@!156562245566857217>
9524,2020-10-06T12:06:08.484000+00:00,But I'd say they're definitely meaning something else
9525,2020-10-06T12:05:25.228000+00:00,Could be of course
9526,2020-10-06T12:05:14.338000+00:00,"Because an insight isn't a context, nor a requirement, nor a recommendation"
9527,2020-10-06T12:04:47.639000+00:00,I think those mean different things too
9528,2020-10-06T07:25:29.062000+00:00,"Here's an ""interesting"" philosophical question for you all: So, to my mind the goal of doing research is to help along the design process. You're creating credible evidence on how to move forward in the design process. I see a lot of job ads that say they want you to provide context, offer insights and collect requirements. 

My question is: is an insight/context/requirement/recommendation different names for the same ""thing"" you're producing through your research? Maybe packaged slightly differently?"
9529,2020-10-06T05:19:26.040000+00:00,Oh sorry about that! doing that rn üôÇ

9556,2020-10-05T08:26:02.156000+00:00,it just means you only need to focus on the inights to play around with and you know how to get back to the specific info without getting lost in a sea of text
9557,2020-10-05T08:25:43.572000+00:00,"That's a good way of storing the specific details but it sounds like it's a ""how do i keep all this in my head when im thinking about what to *do* with this information"" problem.

It looks like the insights are the core thing you're looking to think about/justify. You could make a seperate insight list or diagram that references back to individual interviews where that insight became apparent. Then all you need to do is look at a diagram or a collection of flash cards with the insights on them and you know what interviews to reference if you want to look at the more specific information"
9558,2020-10-05T08:21:17.167000+00:00,"ah yeah I get you, it might feel like eventually you'll be hiding the bigger picture from yourself"
9559,2020-10-05T08:15:47.334000+00:00,this is how im currently organizing it! So this is my left most column and then it every column is one interviewee
9560,2020-10-05T08:14:35.435000+00:00,but im just wondering if there is a better way to do it :/
9561,2020-10-05T08:14:26.468000+00:00,"it starts off with the interviewee and then it sections off into the their general response and right next to it an insight that I can derive from this response

& this is segregated into different topics"
9562,2020-10-05T08:12:26.513000+00:00,How are you currently organising the info on the spreadsheet? üôÇ
9563,2020-10-05T08:11:25.306000+00:00,Yes currently I am hosting the information in an excel! But afraid it might soon become abit too content heavy and don't know how to extract information in a way that is helpful
9564,2020-10-05T08:10:39.713000+00:00,yes more for keeping track of information
9565,2020-10-05T08:10:05.603000+00:00,"If this information was just for me, i'd probably copy and paste similarly themed ideas/talking points from  across the interviews (with a reference back to the origfinal interview)into one place, maybe a spread sheet, and then write down the hypothesis or varations of hypothesis i can observe from studying that similiarly themed material. It really depends what helps keep it in your head"
9566,2020-10-05T08:06:47.645000+00:00,"Oh yes, I understand üôÇ is this to help keep track of information for yourself or would you be presenting this as information to someone else?"
9567,2020-10-05T08:04:58.512000+00:00,I am in sort of an exploration phase
9568,2020-10-05T08:04:47.864000+00:00,"<@!156562245566857217> hmmm yes! Deffo on that! But also on the part about collating similarities across user interviews / typing it out etc!

Do you have a process or resources that you could point me towards?"
9569,2020-10-05T08:04:14.233000+00:00,no probs <@!209640428151111680> ! it looks like you're not starting from square one so thats good üôÇ

9571,2020-10-05T08:03:29.782000+00:00,I can show you what I did
9572,2020-10-05T08:03:20.871000+00:00,"<@!735822780532129822> because you're looking to synthesize something from those insights, it may be best to treat each insight as a hypothesis that needs to be tested. My gut says the next steps would be to look for the patterns and unique insights between interviews and figure out appropriate tests that give you  a deeper understanding of the issues you've identified and also regarding what people say vs. what they do in regard to what you're interviewing about"
9573,2020-10-05T08:03:19.296000+00:00,I may have niccy! Currently in that process
9574,2020-10-05T08:00:03.919000+00:00,Those points seen useful either eay though!
9575,2020-10-05T07:59:50.591000+00:00,"Thanks, those are useful points! Luckily the users are in CX so they have a good idea what a journey is"
9576,2020-10-05T07:58:52.458000+00:00,does anyone have any tips on how to synthesize user interview transcripts/ insights?
9577,2020-10-05T07:51:45.802000+00:00,"<@!209640428151111680> take this suggestion with a grain of salt because this is only off the top of my head: if the user isn't too familiar with the idea of a journey map you could explain to them that it's like a journey in real life where you need: 
- the equipment to undertake the journey, 
- the skills to know how to use the equipment and navigate the terrain and,
- the knowledge of the path that gives you the best chance of getting to your destination

Help them figure out what those things are in the journey of a general day, and maybe those can act as category headings and you can write each individual skill, ""equipment"", possible dangers of the terrain/path etc. under those categories and then talk about how each of those things on the cards relate to/interact each other to build a picture of at least what they percieve their day to be"
9578,2020-10-05T07:26:38.913000+00:00,My idea was to just let then plan out their general day
9579,2020-10-05T07:26:14.898000+00:00,Are there specific techniques one can use?
9580,2020-10-05T07:26:00.190000+00:00,I want to create a user journey together with the user

9593,2020-10-02T17:32:52.312000+00:00,Ah. begun the stakeholder wars have.
9594,2020-10-02T17:32:51.710000+00:00,"i do like maybe integrating a SUS/SEQ in there for mixed methods purposes. We currently don't have a lot of research, so i'm dealing with a lot of opinions from different directions and hoping to establish more data-informed processes"
9595,2020-10-02T17:31:43.590000+00:00,"> The cheap and scrappy way to do it, would be to assume that it's OK after a brief expert evaluation by yourself / any other UX-minded people‚Äîand then only revisit the topic of making it more performant if other related user testing showed issues
<@!218928410263683073> hmm, yea, i also keep an eye out for all the moving pieces even during other tests. Right now we do have a split where UX is saying that anything more than 4 or 5 can hurt the scanability, and then we have stakeholders saying throw more items in the grid (to fit like 7 in a row). So of course, we'll need data to validate these opinions. So I feel a bit ü§∑  on how to go about it because it can be subjective to the customer who's browsing in the page, but also, we have a lot of elements within a card item, so I'm fully aware that it can be overwhelming if we do put a lot of them together in a row."
9596,2020-10-02T17:23:57.126000+00:00,I've been trying to find google scholar docs that are related
9597,2020-10-02T17:23:25.513000+00:00,this has some a brief blurb about searching vs exploring
9598,2020-10-02T17:23:12.152000+00:00,"I dont know if this has citations (honestly it should, ux articles should always cite) but"

9600,2020-10-02T17:22:34.509000+00:00,"> You may discover that the ""right number""  is entirely subjective
<@!218928410263683073> yea, that's what i'm suspecting"
9601,2020-10-02T17:19:13.499000+00:00,as opposed to examining the performance of list sizes in abstract of task based analysis
9602,2020-10-02T17:18:41.360000+00:00,"The cheap and scrappy way to do it, would be to assume that it's OK after a brief expert evaluation by yourself / any other UX-minded people‚Äîand then only revisit the topic of making it more performant if other related user testing showed issues"
9603,2020-10-02T17:15:50.019000+00:00,so randomizing order might be of value to the system
9604,2020-10-02T17:15:11.213000+00:00,i think you may discover that items on the far right get looked at less though
9605,2020-10-02T17:13:36.559000+00:00,"and so time to task will likely depend on

1. How far they need to seek
2. If you have any tools the user can use to reduce their seek time. Filters, Search, etc."
9606,2020-10-02T17:11:14.678000+00:00,not collecting information until the oldest stuff falls out of their head
9607,2020-10-02T17:11:04.439000+00:00,"but again, because people arent comparing, it might not be a big deal. I'd say that users dont try and retain information when they scan lists. They are in seek mode, where they are skipping past any non-relevant information and immediately discarding it"
9608,2020-10-02T17:06:16.514000+00:00,"from a performance aspect, I would say to be aware of the magical number 7 (+/- 2) https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Magical_Number_Seven,_Plus_or_Minus_Two"
9609,2020-10-02T17:02:38.163000+00:00,"You may discover that the ""right number""  is entirely subjective"
9610,2020-10-02T16:59:10.044000+00:00,"With that being said, i dont think this is the sort of thing that probably needs a lot of validation, unless you're doing something real crazy with it"
9611,2020-10-02T16:58:38.842000+00:00,Yeah in general I would say that time to task is probably the best way to evaluate this if you're trying to be non-subjective about it. Otherwise something like SEQ/SUS might at the least highlight if there is a problem with what you made.
9612,2020-10-02T16:38:20.649000+00:00,"i mean - we've done the competitive analysis, which is why we came up with that hypothesis. Right now we're at the stage of validating that decision."
9613,2020-10-02T16:34:45.883000+00:00,because they have done a lot of internal research in this area
9614,2020-10-02T16:34:37.479000+00:00,"with that being said, maybe look at Amazon as a baseline"
9615,2020-10-02T16:34:22.099000+00:00,"Got it. If you're talking web view, I would say that it should probably be dictated by the width of the screen with some minimum number at small-ish sizes. like 3-5."
9616,2020-10-02T16:16:50.158000+00:00,this is what they'd see
9617,2020-10-02T16:15:20.229000+00:00,"don't think people generally compare products, unless you encounter similar ones (like, if i see different types of salsa)"
9618,2020-10-02T16:13:40.432000+00:00,"my scenerio is grocery online shopping, so it's a mix of specific search behavior and general browsing"
9619,2020-10-02T16:09:48.425000+00:00,I think there are heuristics depending on what you're trying to accomplish. Is the user shopping like in the example? Are they making comparisons between things? Do they need to remember things that they've seen? Are they looking for something specific?
9620,2020-10-02T15:48:26.978000+00:00,"i have another one - y'all ready? (I'm not super used to doing a lot of these types of studies and want to gut-check and get advice/feedback) (especially since they're unmoderated üôÉ  yay constraints)

what sort of usability testing approach or metrics should I be looking into if I wanted to test how many product cards should be shown in a row?

hypothesis:  4 to 5 is better for scanability, anything more than that, and it can become information overload. 

I was thinking maybe the tasks can be around timing (time to complete task), and scanability + accuracy (tell them to look for certain items and see if they can find all of them). Perhaps also coupled with ""which one do you prefer"" --- but again, I'm not entirely sure."
9621,2020-10-02T15:41:02.811000+00:00,thanks for the feedback prototype! üòÑ
9622,2020-10-02T15:29:52.940000+00:00,"And if it does, you just run your 4th group"
9623,2020-10-02T15:27:13.479000+00:00,"So you probably only need to test 2 or 3 variants. 

New One with label, 
New One without label,

<@!181895166460690432> Within subject design, and yes you randomize the order in which people see the icons to minimize order effect issues. Using a within subjects design also allows people to do direct comparisons between both icons and say what they like and dislike about each, combination. I doubt that mental overload is gonna be an issue for you based on what you shared. Depending on what you are showing and if you are only showing one thing at a time you can randomize it with a latin square, but that's sometimes overkill, and with large amounts of items it gets complicated very easy.

9692,2020-09-30T00:16:59.419000+00:00,"Regarding surveys, if you do think gender is necessary to your survey, I think there's multiple levels of flexibility you can give to participants.

Level 1: **Radio buttons/dropdown only.** Male, female, nonbinary, etc.‚Äîthis is what many sites have. It's not terrible per-se, especially with multiple gender options, but it does lack flexibility as the onus is on the researcher to constantly be researching new terms to define others and it will be limited by the researcher's knowledge.

Level 2: **Radio buttons + write-in form field.** This means that the researcher has to only pick the ""most popular"" genders and then allow the participant to write in their own. It's moderate flexibility and can be used for most surveys. However, be aware a lot of survey tools will automatically append, ""Other..."" to the form field, which can be unintentionally telling the participant, ""anything I can't think of in these radio buttons will be considered Other.""

Level 3: **Write in form field.** Total flexibility, and the participant can write in whatever they want. This causes some researchers anxiety about synthesis, I understand, though in small sample sizes I've found the work to synthesize these to be next to 0 effort. (For reference, my sample size in this case was 40 people). When it comes to larger sample sizes say, over 200+, you may want to go for something less flexible... but TBH when you export everything into a spreadsheet and sort alphabetically most of the time clear groupings emerge even with form fields."
9693,2020-09-30T00:12:20.983000+00:00,"<@!684946886645383184> Good question! I'm nonbinary, so I would have preferred a nonbinary or gender non-conforming option as well, as I fit neither into male/female and if the only option I'm given outside of these is, ""prefer not to say"" I have the impression that outside of the binary, I don't have an option to disclose. 

My biggest question on this is, *""How does gender affect how the data will be interpreted?""* simply because I believe that, for the most part, gender is a societal construct and unless you're testing how society impacts a certain group of people, I don't think it has relevance in a survey. 

For instance, if I find out that respondents who were women say they like purple bubblegum and respondents who were men say they prefer green bubblegum, I'm not sure if that's a true correlation to say, ""women prefer purple bubblegum over green"" because we don't really know why the respondents answered in this way and why their gender has anything to do with purple bubblegum. This can lead to false equivalencies in surveys and marketing where people say, ""women prefer..."" without diving in deeper into the *why* and instead rely on stereotypes to supply the why.

9825,2020-09-23T07:45:43.200000+00:00,yeah. it's not allowed because you have to add the javscript into that website.
9826,2020-09-23T07:43:42.138000+00:00,I don't think you can see analytics of other websites if they don't allow you to do so
9827,2020-09-23T07:42:19.058000+00:00,"Yeah, I know you can do it inside the website, usually with JavaScript, but I don't know if you can see it of other websites indeed"

9829,2020-09-23T07:40:24.736000+00:00,only if you hv access to the Google analytics of that website though
9830,2020-09-23T07:39:32.681000+00:00,Afaik google analytics can do that
9831,2020-09-22T16:43:35.091000+00:00,"does anyone know a resource where i can find out the stats of certain websites like how many desktop users vs. mobile, how many website users vs. mobile app users? i saw https://www.similarweb.com/ was wondering if there is something else"
9832,2020-09-22T14:31:02.644000+00:00,"Haha not an uncommon problem! Thanks for providing more context. In that case what you're suggesting makes sense, framing it as a way to identify areas for improvement and using that as a springboard to do more qual studies in the areas that your team feels would deliver the biggest impact in conversion, retention, etc. 

It's a great way to start the org down the path of good research practices where quant and qual inform each other."
9833,2020-09-22T14:23:13.838000+00:00,So in a way it's great because we have alot of freedom and flexibility but it also means more room for error haha. That is why I was thinking of starting out just tracking completion metrics for different workflows because that is an easy way we can tell if designs are generally effective?
9834,2020-09-22T14:22:09.545000+00:00,"Our stakeholders only care at a very very high level, so it is up to the UX team to build the linkage of what drives overall business objectives. For example their objective might just be "" Introduce advanced notification features as it is the most common sales request"" and success metric is ""notifications feature is good enough we can drive 15% increase in sales next quarter through nabbing XYZ prospective clients who wanted this feature"".. but they don't really care what is the definition of ""good"" in design."
9835,2020-09-22T14:20:21.375000+00:00,"Well I think tying in the moderated sessions with analytics is part of the long term goal, but usually our moderated sessions are done at the design step to validate prototypes, and the analytics are gathered from live shipped product. So it would take say, 6+ months for final, tested designs to appear in the product. But I agree that seems like a great way to confirm the effectiveness (or ineffectiveness...) of the tests we conduct at the prototyping stage."
9836,2020-09-22T13:40:34.169000+00:00,You could perhaps take some of the research projects that you conducted for the moderated sessions (since those were already sanctioned) and correlate with quant data from FullStory to give you a fuller picture.
9837,2020-09-22T13:39:28.530000+00:00,<@!252528597112193024> It's important to track metrics that tie back to things the business would like to measure. What are some of those things? What questions do stakeholders have?
9838,2020-09-21T23:02:57.114000+00:00,"I am relatively new to using these advanced tracking tools (my PM used Hotjar at a startup I was at before but I didn't have my own login) and previously we have only used internal custom-built tracking tools where we told the devs what we wanted to track and they built a dashboard for us.

Are there any common ""easy wins"" type projects to start out with? My experience till now has mostly been with moderated sessions. Would appreciate being pointed in the right direction for some resources.

I am thinking of starting out with tracking ""completion"" for different workflows.. Would love to hear of any success stories from using these newer tracking softwares."

9851,2020-09-21T14:34:53.713000+00:00,Man recently been playing around with FullStory and it is so neat! Very interesting watching people use our product.
9852,2020-09-20T11:46:10.319000+00:00,"Also one thing, don‚Äôt see this as a critique of your work. Your goal is to invalidate or validate your designs. So when you get results like these, you have done your job. You now can try another design and test that to see if the user is more easily guided in round 2. üòÑ"
9853,2020-09-20T11:40:18.632000+00:00,"I know how you feel! I remember at the beginning when I was doing A/B testing and looking at Hotjar behaviour analytics and was always so surprised! If there is one button, think about what else on the screen could be distracting the users. Is there a wealth of other information? Is their eye guided to the button? Is the UX microcopy not clear enough? What about the button color? Different colors have different conversion rates. üôÇ"

<@!537120266745020416>  Oh! üòÑ Great prototype test by the way. I took it. What are you looking for exactly for methodology tips and tricks? I always found A/B testing the most straightforward methodology. I can only share my experience testing live websites like landing pages and prototypes with these tools I mentioned and many more tools for live website testing. The one thing is that I am always surprised by which design performs better. For me, it is almost always the design that I personally wouldn‚Äôt have picked so it really challenges your biases as a designer, and gets you to focus on the design that better serves the user. A/B testing makes you really aware about what is more effective and why in a design. Typically, after an A/B test, it provides for new design opportunities, to then iterate again. üôÇ"

9954,2020-09-09T10:40:55.362000+00:00,You're kind of design is similar to Calum's right?

9956,2020-09-09T10:39:59.950000+00:00,I need to design something that can influence behaviour of how somebody moves through an office. Like keeping 1.5 distance at the coffee machine
9957,2020-09-09T10:39:10.494000+00:00,"Basically. Offices aren't covid friendly. The measures taken are mainly warnings, which aren't effective to a lot of people, most will look 1 or 2 times at these warnings then they blend in the environment"
9958,2020-09-09T10:37:18.633000+00:00,Can you elaborate on what it is you want to do? I'm not sure I fully understand it.
9959,2020-09-09T10:37:03.471000+00:00,"A close environment can create tunnel vision, which is good for focus, but not for creativity"
9960,2020-09-09T10:37:01.966000+00:00,so wouldn't want to work from home 100% of the time for sure
9961,2020-09-09T10:36:52.745000+00:00,change in scenery always helps me

9963,2020-09-09T10:36:12.492000+00:00,"Though I guess the moral of the story is that the office environment can influence you creativity, because there are a lot of external factors"

9965,2020-09-09T10:35:00.945000+00:00,"Often a lot of space, few desks"

9972,2020-09-09T10:32:56.731000+00:00,I see.
9973,2020-09-09T10:32:42.497000+00:00,One of the user cases I read:
9974,2020-09-09T10:32:35.038000+00:00,"Yeah they do, but being able to feed from each others creativity, and a nice environment are important to creativity"
9975,2020-09-09T10:32:07.121000+00:00,I can understand why.
9976,2020-09-09T10:31:44.123000+00:00,"Right now an office is like a traffic road, with warning signs everywhere ahhaha"
9977,2020-09-09T10:31:28.063000+00:00,I thought most innovative or creative studios found ways to work renote.

9990,2020-09-09T10:27:49.755000+00:00,I thought people were not in office workspaces anymore.

9998,2020-09-08T07:32:08.484000+00:00,"For example, I'd figure the management section has a lot of power, since they are the 'ruling' party. If they think something isn't smart to do, it won't happen"
9999,2020-09-08T07:31:21.851000+00:00,How should I interpret these 'influences' or 'interests'?

The management section, who has low interest but high power

And my study, who also has low interest and high power"

10005,2020-09-07T08:51:04.554000+00:00,I think they were especially popular in 1960 marketing when you could easily define some guy with long hair and listens rock n roll
10006,2020-09-07T08:50:17.396000+00:00,"As the needs of an individual can change with time and context all the time, such as arousal etc"
10007,2020-09-07T08:48:29.189000+00:00,So it's hard to describe the dynamic personality of the user with a system that only allows a static personality
10008,2020-09-07T08:47:12.105000+00:00,One strong point is that personalities aren't static
10009,2020-09-07T08:47:00.261000+00:00,I guess there are some different opinions about it
10010,2020-09-06T23:11:09.034000+00:00,"Yeah, think its important to remember that a persona is simply a tool used to represent user goals. So you often see added demographic info and stuff that doesn't need to be there and makes them weak. Can definitely see why people have problems with them when people make them into something they're not supposed to be and add 0 value when they do so. 

I can see their value but 100% agree that you don't always need them. And no point in making one if you aren't going to use it and simply check off the box in a process. 

I think the biggest problem with personas is they're deceptively simple because the info they represent is synthesized from complex things and you don't always see how the person arrived at the info/goals. 

But I'm also biased as I'm a fan of cooper generally speaking.

10013,2020-09-06T18:29:54.783000+00:00,"But personas, especially if there wasn't any data collected to back them up, are sometimes more detrimental than good."

10023,2020-09-06T17:47:00.755000+00:00,"Personas are definitely a good tool for communication. I've used them when organizing research for non-academic audiences.

10090,2020-09-02T00:27:38.794000+00:00,side note but had to share
10091,2020-09-02T00:12:12.852000+00:00,"> My project is to nudge people into 'good' behaviour in the office space with covid-19, so that they can use the office space again
> So for that I need the current situation as in; what does the office look like with new changes in place, what is the subjective experience of those changes
<@!209640428151111680>, to aid your future research effots, I want to echo a point <@!218928410263683073> made briefly: you need to turn the research into more digestible steps. Think through how you break down the problem, sort of like you have done here, but go farther. 

For example, based on what you said and confirmed, above, I would break this problem down as follows:
What is ""good behavior?"" How will I know if the nudges I've used have worked? What nudges should I even employ in the first place?

From that last question, you've broken it into 2 steps, I see more:

What does the office look like with COVID changes in place? -- What are the changes? (record these in a detailed manner) How do I feel about the changes? (You are asking a qualitative question, so you need to identify your position on the question)

What is the subjective experience of those changes? -- What is ""subjective experience?"" Are you talking about affect/emotions? Are you more interested in behavior and performance? Self-reported performance? Feelings of community and belongingness? Operationalize your variables.

After you break it out like this, it is easier to see what you are looking for. No more gathering a bunch of data and pulling at strings. You may not have a strict hypothesis (although I feel like that wouldn't be difficult to posit), but you have an *objective*"
10092,2020-09-01T23:58:58.738000+00:00,"Also, not to be nit-picky and weird, but I am: UX Research *is* the scientific method. You are making assumptions and testing them. Always. And when you are doing generative research, you are using Qualitative Research methods, which are just as scientific."
10093,2020-09-01T23:58:01.873000+00:00,"Not to dissuade user research, but to make it more impactful."
10094,2020-09-01T23:57:17.944000+00:00,"I agree with what <@!218928410263683073> has offered up as answers, and I think you should consider what secondary research you can do before jumping into talking to users"
10095,2020-09-01T23:56:09.416000+00:00,"People spend their entire dissertations making scales that measure specific constructs, and if you derive the wrong metrics from your sample, you can bias your results in a way that makes them unusable."
10096,2020-09-01T23:54:47.591000+00:00,"> For example, if I think ""sociality with colleagues"" is a metric. Or should I go in completely open and just do interviews and let them make up their own metrics
<@!209640428151111680> I would recommend doing some literature review first. Look for measures people have created and apply these. There is a lot of I/O Psychological research on workplace behavior, and making your own scale (and metrics) is a research project in its own right."
10097,2020-09-01T22:48:28.442000+00:00,of course! I'm excited to hear about your results
10098,2020-09-01T22:45:18.782000+00:00,I'll share when I've some results! Thanks a ton :)!
10099,2020-09-01T22:44:08.264000+00:00,"Yeah, that's definitely nice for the essays/whitepaper and all that too!"
10100,2020-09-01T22:43:18.369000+00:00,"that points back to interviews, and research"
10101,2020-09-01T22:43:11.455000+00:00,and then being able to rationalize your decision making to stakeholders with metrics and reasoning
10102,2020-09-01T22:42:57.028000+00:00,"i've done a lot of this goofy soft research in the past, and it's really ~~less~~ just about feeling confident in the designer in your decision making, because you feel informed"
10103,2020-09-01T22:41:46.180000+00:00,and cut the stuff that isnt impactful or valuable
10104,2020-09-01T22:41:43.350000+00:00,"Thanks, I can definitely manage that! I'm in office again friday, so that's when I can start interviewing face to face"
10105,2020-09-01T22:41:23.803000+00:00,"on a scale of 1-5, how important is ____ to your office environment / experience"
10106,2020-09-01T22:41:13.540000+00:00,add a scale questionnaire to your interview
10107,2020-09-01T22:40:50.946000+00:00,or you can do it all in one go
10108,2020-09-01T22:40:26.440000+00:00,just one way to do it
10109,2020-09-01T22:40:13.148000+00:00,"and then use that second round of data to weight your metrics, or refine them"
10110,2020-09-01T22:39:58.747000+00:00,or however you want to phrase it to not lead them
10111,2020-09-01T22:39:53.165000+00:00,preference to be in that office is
10112,2020-09-01T22:39:43.334000+00:00,"have them watch a youtube video of an office where the environment is X, and then ask them on a scale what their idk"
10113,2020-09-01T22:38:59.814000+00:00,and then round 2 is you take those metrics and measure them subjectively. Like
10114,2020-09-01T22:38:49.528000+00:00,and then you synthesize and generate your metrics (scales) out of that
10115,2020-09-01T22:38:41.905000+00:00,"ya you could do it like that, or you can do two rounds. Round 1 is just interviews, general conversation about what makes an office great, what makes work environments great, etc. what they hate? pain points."
10116,2020-09-01T22:37:42.430000+00:00,Like some kind of card sort
10117,2020-09-01T22:37:35.239000+00:00,"For example, if I think ""sociality with colleagues"" is a metric. Or should I go in completely open and just do interviews and let them make up their own metrics"
10118,2020-09-01T22:36:08.096000+00:00,Can I make assumptions about those metrics though?
10119,2020-09-01T22:35:54.293000+00:00,"Yeah that sounds like a very good idea! üòÑ I've done stuff with metrics before, and used them together with users to make it more easy to interview in context. But this seems very effective when those metrics aren't defined"
10120,2020-09-01T22:31:28.197000+00:00,and you might end up surprised by what your /users/ (coworkers?) find important
10121,2020-09-01T22:30:39.425000+00:00,"wrap your brain around it a bit, or at least turn it into more digestible steps"
10122,2020-09-01T22:30:19.580000+00:00,helps frame / contextualize the problem
10123,2020-09-01T22:30:13.009000+00:00,"but because this is more generative, you can let the ""metric definition"" phase be a part of the discovery research"
10124,2020-09-01T22:29:42.469000+00:00,it's safe to choose the metrics yourself
10125,2020-09-01T22:29:37.601000+00:00,"ya, if it was something you were super familiar with"
10126,2020-09-01T22:29:02.649000+00:00,It makes sense to let the user choose metrics instead of me
10127,2020-09-01T22:28:47.012000+00:00,Thanks a ton! I've never actually thought about turning it around like that
10128,2020-09-01T22:28:38.655000+00:00,goodl uck mate you'll learn a lot!
10129,2020-09-01T22:27:45.948000+00:00,good luck Dario
10130,2020-09-01T22:27:19.468000+00:00,!!!
10131,2020-09-01T22:27:19.147000+00:00,I'm going to apply that
10132,2020-09-01T22:27:17.967000+00:00,"you could do it unethically, and subject people to things that you know they wont like, and then see what impacts the overall experience the most"
10133,2020-09-01T22:27:14.429000+00:00,I think that's a very good idea!
10134,2020-09-01T22:26:25.610000+00:00,"Definitely sounds like an interesting way, using the users themselves to create metrics"
10135,2020-09-01T22:26:11.375000+00:00,"maybe a little less frivolous, but the concept is there"
10136,2020-09-01T22:25:57.947000+00:00,kind of
10137,2020-09-01T22:25:39.093000+00:00,ya
10138,2020-09-01T22:25:34.284000+00:00,"Kind of like how spotify uses their data metrics like 'danceability, energy, etc' for their music?"
10139,2020-09-01T22:24:47.474000+00:00,I don't always know what i'm doing üòõ
10140,2020-09-01T22:24:42.055000+00:00,thats how i'd do it anyways. lol
10141,2020-09-01T22:24:35.671000+00:00,"i like this research, it sounds fun"
10142,2020-09-01T22:24:09.083000+00:00,"to see how those concepts move the metrics, and maybe the underlying causes"
10143,2020-09-01T22:24:01.352000+00:00,"and then create some sort of design fiction / prototype of some polarized concepts, and subject your subject(s) to them"
10144,2020-09-01T22:23:35.844000+00:00,and then benchmark the /current/ experience against those metrics for a baseline
10145,2020-09-01T22:23:19.403000+00:00,"noise, distance, whatever, perks, accessbility, whatever"
10146,2020-09-01T22:23:00.874000+00:00,and converting those to metrics
10147,2020-09-01T22:22:57.704000+00:00,maybe as easy as interviewing people and asking them what parts of the office experience are important to them
10148,2020-09-01T22:22:44.090000+00:00,so you can figure out how you need to move those metrics
10149,2020-09-01T22:22:37.509000+00:00,"got it, so there are a couple of things you need to figure out like, what are the metrics you are going to use to measure the experience"
10150,2020-09-01T22:22:18.559000+00:00,IoT thingies
10151,2020-09-01T22:22:11.030000+00:00,Then use smart office concepts to realize that
10152,2020-09-01T22:22:01.883000+00:00,Yup!
10153,2020-09-01T22:21:49.646000+00:00,in order to get to that point?
10154,2020-09-01T22:21:46.243000+00:00,and then figure out what actually needs to change
10155,2020-09-01T22:21:29.570000+00:00,"so you're trying to identify some form of ideal experience, within the parameters of what needs to change"
10156,2020-09-01T22:21:02.063000+00:00,ah. understood. this seems more straight forward to me
10157,2020-09-01T22:20:57.184000+00:00,And how can I influence this
10158,2020-09-01T22:20:46.233000+00:00,"So for that I need the current situation as in; what does the office look like with new changes in place, what is the subjective experience of those changes"
10159,2020-09-01T22:17:11.851000+00:00,"My project is to nudge people into 'good' behaviour in the office space with covid-19, so that they can use the office space again"
10160,2020-09-01T22:15:51.438000+00:00,just more iterative
10161,2020-09-01T22:15:46.084000+00:00,"identify a problem, come up with a hypothesis, test it, rinse/repeat"
10162,2020-09-01T22:15:36.318000+00:00,UX research is kinda like the scientific method
10163,2020-09-01T22:15:17.799000+00:00,"one of the canvas activities might help you, business model canvas maybe. i'm not sure what your project actually is, so it's hard to be specific"
10164,2020-09-01T22:14:17.376000+00:00,Are there any models you guys use for plan of actions at the start of a project?
10165,2020-09-01T22:13:13.174000+00:00,Plan of action.
10166,2020-09-01T22:13:08.247000+00:00,Yeah. I think that answers my question too. Thanks üòÑ
10167,2020-09-01T22:04:23.402000+00:00,Basically a plan of action I think
10168,2020-09-01T22:02:48.311000+00:00,understood
10169,2020-09-01T22:02:42.020000+00:00,"So not the process of researching itself, but the process of structuring research"
10170,2020-09-01T22:02:19.093000+00:00,I think it's more meta than that. I want to structure the specific categories I want to make assumptions about
10171,2020-09-01T22:01:21.782000+00:00,"like, our assumption is X  and so now you're doing research to validate that assumption"
10172,2020-09-01T22:01:05.172000+00:00,Have you tried starting with an assumption?
10173,2020-09-01T22:00:49.603000+00:00,I think it's purely generative
10174,2020-09-01T22:00:38.719000+00:00,to find threads to pull out and chase
10175,2020-09-01T22:00:33.669000+00:00,and so you're trying to just collect as much data as you can
10176,2020-09-01T22:00:26.280000+00:00,"I think if you're reaching the point where the data you're gathering is spread real wide, it's because you arent segmenting your research as much, almost like you don't know what you should be looking for"
10177,2020-09-01T21:59:45.206000+00:00,"or maybe, how generative or formative is your research."
10178,2020-09-01T21:59:08.550000+00:00,how open ended is your research?
10179,2020-09-01T21:58:35.121000+00:00,"Usually when I research, I end up with tons of transcripts, bits of APA sources here and there. And then I kind of find out a lot wasn't really relevant to the question"
10180,2020-09-01T21:57:42.628000+00:00,"I've been doing a current situation research. I want to break down every element to plan the scope of the research, to prevent too much irrelevant data. 

Not so much as in, how will I structure the interview, but more like why does this interview need to happen in the first place"
10181,2020-09-01T21:53:11.375000+00:00,Also I'd argue I'm mediocre at best. My experience with research plans has been academic in scope

10184,2020-09-01T20:21:03.521000+00:00,"Scope of the research, goals, and all that."

10222,2020-08-31T15:05:14.410000+00:00,That could be interesting
10223,2020-08-31T15:05:08.567000+00:00,hmmmm good question - it may depend on how you want to compare and present the data
10224,2020-08-31T15:04:15.650000+00:00,hmm would it be bad practice if i did like 5 moderated 10 unmoderated
10225,2020-08-31T15:03:10.133000+00:00,Especially interviews.

10230,2020-08-31T15:02:25.153000+00:00,but i was like
10231,2020-08-31T15:02:21.875000+00:00,ah yea cause i read that i should have about 15 participants
10232,2020-08-31T15:01:52.957000+00:00,unmoderated is great to reduce bias and run a lot more participants
10233,2020-08-31T15:01:25.762000+00:00,"moderated is great for when you still have a lot of questions, so that way you can ask for people's thoughts."
10234,2020-08-31T15:00:48.620000+00:00,i've never done card sort with users before
10235,2020-08-31T15:00:45.966000+00:00,"But I'd rather do a workshop in person, because then I can hear people mulling over their ideas."
10236,2020-08-31T15:00:44.217000+00:00,ty this is useful lol
10237,2020-08-31T14:59:26.506000+00:00,framing a scenario for the user is always helpful (at the beginning of the task)
10238,2020-08-31T14:59:15.385000+00:00,yup
10239,2020-08-31T14:59:09.816000+00:00,What I think I should have done for context was simply explain that it's for a non-profit rabbit shelter.
10240,2020-08-31T14:58:42.067000+00:00,"i always go for clarity without giving too much away, so asking ""what's the least i can give away without affecting or biasing participant results"""
10241,2020-08-31T14:58:24.484000+00:00,"Luckily, the site itself is small/local, so it's focused a lot on rabbit care and upkeep."

10245,2020-08-31T14:57:41.914000+00:00,lol hmm...i wonder how much that affected results
10246,2020-08-31T14:57:37.885000+00:00,"Reading into it and comparing them, not really, since it was things like ""Care,"" ""Policies,"" etc."
10247,2020-08-31T14:57:31.590000+00:00,"ahaha i didn't think of that, i'll definitely keep that in mind"
10248,2020-08-31T14:57:04.027000+00:00,"So I was thinking, just how much information should I have provided?"
10249,2020-08-31T14:57:02.356000+00:00,do you think that affected the results?
10250,2020-08-31T14:56:56.352000+00:00,LOL
10251,2020-08-31T14:56:36.575000+00:00,"One time, I did a project about a non-profit shelter and needed to structure their main menu, so when I sent out the terms, I had someone who thought the whole thing was about child adoption, not animal adoption."
10252,2020-08-31T14:55:58.829000+00:00,One of the things that made me feel weird about doing card sorts and looking through the results was knowing how much context/background info to give participants.

10256,2020-08-31T14:52:36.175000+00:00,"yea, like if they share their screen?"
10257,2020-08-31T14:52:15.950000+00:00,"I actually never thought of that, like a virtual card sort while they're working on OW? I've sent out card sorts before, but I've never done in-person card sorting."
10258,2020-08-31T14:49:28.301000+00:00,but idk i kinda want to watch how some of them do it...and i might have some questions for them
10259,2020-08-31T14:49:09.668000+00:00,like will it cause unnecessary pressure? if they feel like someone is watching them? cause i think that optimalworkshop gives you the results and analysis data after they complete the test
10260,2020-08-31T14:48:23.968000+00:00,do you know if i (the ux designer) can be present during the time they are doing the card sort/tree test?
10261,2020-08-31T14:48:00.632000+00:00,has anyone conducted card sort or tree testing on optimalworkshop?
10262,2020-08-31T14:47:27.524000+00:00,ok idk if this is an obvious question but
10263,2020-08-26T23:33:31.740000+00:00,yes!

10270,2020-08-25T16:39:14.497000+00:00,i personally try to get away from those - they can get too buzz-wordy for my taste. and people have like a million definitions too

He has a lot of videos that can help you develop confidence as a UX Researcher and have a better set up for acing the interview. My biggest tip: Embrace ""I don't know."" The interviewers want to know that you aren't afraid of not knowing, since a lot of the time you will need to know what you don't know so that you can properly devise a way to learn that information"

<@!68535086814867456> -Kimberley hit on part of it! Discourse analysis is a great tool from linguistics. It is good for searching through a lot of text to find keywords. Journalism methods I've used are interviewing (which can be pulled from elsewhere, too!), and I hope to use network analysis sometime in the future. I have a big interest in the social side of technology (CSCW, player dynamics, etc), so I think network analysis may prove useful in the future (at least for answering my curiosity questions, if not actual RQs)"
